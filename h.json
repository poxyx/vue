                        "tale": "The dark, cold and mysterious deep sea is the last unexplored frontier in the Land of Dawn. All the way down from surface, the sun fades away and the temperature drops, then there is complete darkness. It is called the Abysmal Sea, where currents and the high pressure are strong enough to tear apart any advanced materials Eruditio has invented. This place is a forbidden zone of life, where no human has ever set foot in. Only the remains of those abandoned and eliminated civilizations have been sinking and piling up.\n\nNevertheless, it is not only death here. Many unbelievable and indescribable creatures, including Atlas, have been struggling and multiplying for ages in this dangerous area. They were among the oldest living things on the Land of Dawn, devouring elemental creatures for power, which made them imprisoned in this deepest place by the Ancient Ones. The powerful Injunction blocked light, heat as well as their upward path. In order to adapt to the high-pressure environment, they removed their shells and redundant structures, and developed a variety of fluid shapes. In the endless darkness, there is no fight and strife, only the law of survival: existence, alternation and circulation.\n\nAges after ages, however, some things have gradually changed. The changes did not originate beneath the ocean but came from above. The succession of civilizations and continuous wars affected not only the land but also the seas. Everything began to deteriorate. Creatures in the Abysmal Sea could no longer adapt to the even worse situation. Withering and death came without warning. The largest of them were the first to contend. These giant fibrous creatures wriggled their tentacles and bodies to rush upwards, but only to be torn apart due to the Injunction.\n\nThe others could not understand their fate, but they knew they needed change - it's an instinct of all living things. Therefore, they started to think about workarounds. They started to try to break the Injunction. The only prisoner who eventually got rid of the Abysmal Sea, was Atlas. As the most experienced individual, he sensed the change sooner than any of his kind when the Abysmal Sea was involved. He was the first to prepare the escape.\n\nThe fleshes torn apart warned the rest creatures that their bodies were vulnerable to the overwhelming power. To break the Injunction, he must regain a rigid shell. Atlas kept wandering and searching over the deep. Until one day, in a pile of those civilization remains, he found his destined shell - the Mecha Sentry, a set of giant ancient machinery armor. These big things were manufactured as war machines by the Iceland Golems who once ruled the Northern Vale. After the demise of the ancient golems, they were abandoned by the later civilizations, thrown into the ocean, and totally forgotten by the world.\n\nAtlas slowly approached the Mecha Sentry, found it decayed on the sea floor like a stiff scrap of iron due to the missing of the control core. He then entered the center of the machine, stretched his tentacles, injected them into each joint, and began to take control. Along with a rumbling noise, the Mecha Sentry who slept for thousands of years lit its eyes again. The forgotten body and the abandoned soul got perfectly combined and unified.\n\nThe giant Mecha Sentry broke through the Injunction, rushed from the deep to the surface, then jumped up above the sea. It was the time the world welcomed a new player - Atlas, the Ironclad Kraken.\n\nAtlas felt strange and curious about this world. He visited everywhere seas can reach driven by the desire for learning and strengthening. He frantically drew knowledge from creatures, races and civilizations. Meanwhile, his control of the Mecha Sentry became more and more proficient. As if the machine was originally made for him. But no matter how long time passed, Atlas is always haunted by a thought - his kind are still struggling in the Abysmal Sea, the biggest jail and the remotest place in the world.\n\nNow, Atlas has not only a hard armor, but also a plan. He will break the Injunction between the Abysmal Sea and the world, save his kind from the eternal imprisonment. There is a secret treasure only the pirates believe that hidden somewhere in the sea of Northern Vale. It has the power to regenerate, powerful enough to change the ecology of an entire ocean. Atlas wants it, from the first time he learned the story.",

                        "tale": "Many years ago, Carmilla was born in the House Ansaac in the Castle Aberleen. As the only daughter of the Earl, she was loved by all her family since birth. When she grew up, her eminent family background coupled with her captivating beauty made her one of the most popular noble ladies around the Castle Aberleen, and maybe even the whole Empire. However, her royal origin was inevitably bound to the tragedy as was to become a political tool of her father Earl Anssac, consolidating power by betrothing her to another family of power.\n\nThough countless aristocrats tried to court Carmilla, none of them pleased her. Her innate pride made her refuse to bow down to mediocrity. What she wanted was someone who could connect with her soul. But, her father Earl Ansaac had already made his decision. As the threat of the abyss was getting closer, he knew that the new class of military-nobles would dominate the politics of the land. Thus, he had to establish good relations with them in order to sustain the social status of his family.\n\nHowever, a man who was a rather insignificant to the old Earl foiled this plan. This man was Cecilion, the best opera singer in the southern Empire. Carmilla became his most loyal audience since the first day he came to the Castle Aberleen. In Carmilla’s eyes, he was just so elegant and talented, but she could also read the melancholy and the mystery from his eyes. For every performance of Cecilion, Carmilla would sit in the right middle in the auditorium, quietly enjoying his song performance. \n\nOne day, as the curtains called, Cecilion and Carmilla's eyes met. The flames of passion ignited between them. And like a bolt of lightning cracking open the dark night sky, they instantly fell in love.\n\nThe days that followed were the happiest ones in Carmilla's life. When night fell, Cecilion dressed up and came to invite her to the opera house, singing songs he composed for her. And Carmilla watched his performance intently, never taking her eyes off him. When the performance ended, they dated at the backstage, dancing in the moonlight. And in the early morning, Cecilion would put a rose on Carmilla's windowsill that was nourished by the morning dew and leave quietly.\n\nAs time went by, Carmilla noticed something unusual about Cecilion. He lived in solitude and never had needless contact with others. His skin was always pale, even when he didn’t makeup; and it seemed that he always tried to avoid something. From his eyes, Carmilla could feel his desire for a normal life, and she could vaguely see that Cecilion might have some connection to the legendary blood demon species. Though Cecilion never talked about his origins with her, she still chose to believe in him, because she could feel his love was real. No matter he was man or blood demon, it was just about love between them, and Carmilla believed that she would always belong to Cecilion, and would spend the rest of her life with him.\n\nThough they loved each other so deeply, Carmilla’s father the Earl forbade her to marry this humble singer. He imprisoned her and forced her to marry Baron Tawil, the general of the imperial army, who was stationed near the Castle Aberleen. In order to make Carmilla forget Cecilion, the Earl even sent his men to close the opera house. In Cecilion’s mind, he knew that the love between the blood demon and mankind would never be true. Though he loved Carmilla, he finally decided to give up. At the day he left, he wrote a letter to her, in which he told her everything, about his origins, his story, and left it with a rose at her windowsill.\n\nCarmilla didn’t stop fighting, she was not willing to succumb to her father's will. But her heart broke when she read his parting letter. To Carmilla, it didn't matter what species he belonged to. She loved him, and without him, her life would become meaningless.\n\nShe stood at the window, watching the direction Cecilion left to. As the dawn was raising, she slit her wrist with a sharp dagger. The world fell into endless darkness. And Carmilla buried her love in her own way.\n\nWhen Carmilla awoke, she found herself once again in Cecilion’s arms. His eyes were full of kindness, and he was looking at her. Then she found that her touch was so cold, as if she was lifeless, and her skin looked just as pale as Cecilion's. She knew, her lover didn’t abandon her, he returned and revived her with his blood. These two lonely souls finally were together again and could live with each other forever.\n\nAfter that day, the people of Castle Aberleen never saw Cecilion or Carmilla again, only the legendary tales of the night, which passed from mouth to mouth over time. When night came, Carmilla nestled in Cecilion's arms above the top tower of Castle Aberleen, as if time stood still.",

                        "tale": "Many years ago, enjoying the night opera performed by Cecilion was the most popular form of entertainment for the people of Castle Aberleen. It was always full house at the theatre each time this most famous opera actor performed. Everyone was attracted by his indescribable beauty and talent. However, the applause, love and cheers from human beings didn’t make Cecilion feel happy. He was one of the Blood Demons, and it was hard for him to open his mind to humans.\n\nAs long as Cecilion could remember, his kind have been living in the place where human beings lived. The oppression of Lord Lava against the blood demons meant a dark future for them. As such, some demons decided to leave the Despair Place and came to live among the humans. They were eager to seek forgiveness from the King of Light, live normally and integrate into the human society. But the fact was that they not only suffered hostility from the human society, but they also hunted down by the Abyss. When Cecilion became an adult, he was the only one left amongst his kind.\n\nIn order to hide his true identity, Cecilion lived in Castle Aberleen as an opera actor and tried to cover up all abilities and characteristics related to the Blood Demons, He was gorgeous and elegant on the stage, surrounded by thousands of people. But at night, Cecilion spent his nights alone, night after night.\n\nThe lonely days continued until Cecilion made an unforgettable performance. When he went to the center of the stage to take his bow, he saw Carmilla. And this beautiful lady was looking at him too. At this moment, the two lonely souls instantly fell in love.\n\nAlthough Cecilion always warned himself against having contact with human beings, he could not resist his love for Carmilla. So he decided to follow his heart. In each performance, Cecilion would sing a song for Carmilla and they never ceased eye contact with each other. When talking about his own life, Cecilion chose to keep it as a secret. Even when Carmilla had doubts about his lifestyle, he still said nothing about it.\n\nAs the flames of love grew stronger, they had met secretly more frequently. Carmilla’s father, Earl Ansaac knew everything about what they did. In his eyes,  the Earl only thought of Cecilion as just humble opera actor. He felt Carmilla should get married with a powerful man. When this couple's love grew deeper, Earl Ansaac violently interrupted the relationship between the two, imprisoned Carmilla, sealed the opera house and exiled Cecilion.\n\nSoon after, there was a rumor that Earl Ansaac was about to marry off his only daughter, Carmilla, to the new Baron Tawil. At this time, Cecilion was so tempted to knock down the guards and take Carmilla away. However, he knew that he couldn’t bring happiness to her, as she would become a fugitive on the run. After careful thought, he thought it best to give up.\n\nThe night was drawing to a close, and at dawn Carmilla was to marry Baron Tawil. Before the first light of dawn, Cecilion placed a rose and a letter with his name at Carmilla's window and turned away.\n\nBut what Cecilion didn’t know was that his enstranged lifestyle was not important to Carmilla and she didn't care if he was a Blood Demon or a human being. She loved Cecilion for who he is. After putting on the white wedding dress,  Carmilla cut her wrist with a sharp dagger, forfeiting her life for he love for Cecilion.\n\nGiving up Carmilla made Cecilion feel terribly sad, and his life seemed to return to what it had been. After two lonely nights, Cecilion went to see Carmilla, from a distance.\n\nBut when Cecilion arrived, he found Carmilla's cold corpse lying still at a solemn funeral. For a moment Cecilion felt nothing but pain and regret. How could he live as a human being without Carmilla? The new moon rose, Cecilion spread his wings and swept through the city in the cold night, taking away his love.\n\nAfter that day, the people of Castle Aberleen never saw Cecilion or Carmilla again. Only the legend of the night, which passed from mouth to mouth over time.\n\nWhen the night came, Carmilla nestled in Cecilion's arms above the top tower of Castle Aberleen, as if time had stood still.",

                        "tale": "The prince has gone missing and no one knows if he's dead or alive! For the sake of the country and the safety of its people, King Aurelius II has decreed to expand Knight's Order and set up fortresses in the outskirts of Moniyan to reinforce the empire’s defense. In the meantime, Imperial Knights continue to search for any clue of the whereabouts of the prince. Imperial Knights search day and night. They have almost crossed the entire Land of Dawn but all they have found is endless waiting. The Aurelius royal family is drowning in sorrow. To young Silvanna, the tragic memory of that time is too heavy. As a princess, Silvanna has always had a heart of justice and compassion since she was little. After her brother's disappearance, she has been keeping the queen company almost every day. For years, the two of them have been waiting for a miracle in the imperial castle. However, day after day, year after year the queen eventually becomes ill and bedridden from physical and mental exhaustion. \n\nTen years has passed. As the queen and the king get older, Princess Silvanna, who’s now an adult, has always wanted to do something for her empire. She wants to let go of the sorrow, but whenever she thinks of her brother, the sadness and frustration always come back to her. Every night in her dream, Silvanna feels like her brother is within reach but she just can’t seem to hold him. Shortly afterward, on the day of Silvanna's coming-of-age ceremony, she decides to disregard her status as a princess and join the Imperial Knights. Perhaps this is the only way for her to bear the pain! \n\nIn the Knight’s Order, Silvanna is about to go through tough training. She will no longer be treated like a royal. Silvanna needs to have a strong faith and work harder than others. Her faith has made her more and more powerful. All the scars on her body are the best proof on her path of training. Before long, she has become the most powerful female knight among the  Imperial Knights. But even then, Silvanna still can’t get Tigreal's special approval. Tigreal knows the cruelty of the real battlefield and how there's no room for any mistake. Deep down, Tigreal sees that Silvanna has already acquired all the skills of a knight. He can also see Silvanna's determination. But she is a royal of the empire after all. Tigreal doesn’t want another successor of the empire to be at any risk again. \n\nBut one day, all of a the sudden, the Demon army has arrived on the outskirts of the empire... Moniyan is in the face of disaster and war. Tigreal orders Silvanna to stay in the empire while he leads the whole Knight’s Order to battle. \n\nHalfway through, Tigreal receives a report from the Knight’s Order that in order to prove herself, Silvanna has broken the forbidden area, the Imperial Sanctuary, where countless unknown creatures lurk. Even Tigreal himself doesn’t have the confidence to go through it unharmed. At this moment, a sharp cry comes from a distance, making Tigreal shudder. He immediately leads the elites of the Knight’s Order back to the Imperial Sanctuary while the rest of the knights go to the outskirts of the empire to fight the Demons. On his way, he prays that he makes it in time. He prays that his fear will not come true. \n\nIn front of the gods of the Imperial Sanctuary, a giant figure is slowly approaching the wounded knightess. The Seed of Light is glowing in the distance and her powerful opponent is approaching. In the imperial records, Silvanna once read about a legend about the Seed of Light in the Imperial Sanctuary. But the powerful creature that guards the Seed of Light in front of her has become an obstacle she can't overcome. But Silvanna knows that only when she’s shielded by the King of Light can she truly become the Holy Knightess and lead the empire to victory in the battle. And for that reason, she is willing to sacrifice her life...",

Tangmen, a faction that was known for their hidden weapons and skilled craft, originated from this land. However, Tangmen’s new leader found that many people often used Tangmen’s crafts and hidden weapons to do evil, which was running against his will. Because of that, he decided to disband his faction and exiled himself to the forest, in a place of solitude with his daughter. \n\nSince birth, Wanwan lived together with her father. The forest was her home and she spent a lot of time hunting and training there. On her fifth birthday, her father gave her a set of needles as a birthday gift that was made from a particular silver found at the bottom of the sea. That day, he also revealed the history of Tangmen to her. This set of Needles was a valuable and secret weapon created by Tangmen, which consisted of a total of 81 needles. Tangmen’s skilled craft forged the Needles into a lethal weapon, killing anyone who dared to challenge its power. Wanwan’s father told her to use the weapon only if she was in danger. That’s the first lesson her father taught her. One day, Wanwan and her father found Black Dragon at the bottom of a cliff. It is the first time that Wanwan saw a person who was injured so badly and she couldn’t bear to leave him alone. With the help of her father, she carried the Black Dragon to their home and took care of him. The Black Dragon was moved by this kind-hearted girl and opened his mind to her. He spent many hours with the young girl, telling her his story, his dream, and his ambition, teaching her how to become more powerful. However, the Black Dragon left Wanwan a few months later without leaving any word, which made Wanwan sad for a long time. \n\nTen years later, Wanwan grew up. Her skills with the darts became more pronounced, being able to split a drop of dew a hundred steps away into 2 with a single dart. Her father told her not to show her formidable skills to others and to keep away from trouble. But Wanwan was too curious and she wanted to travel the world. On the day Wanwan started her journey, her father gave her the most precious craft of Tangmen – the Crossbow of Tang, which could launch a rain of arrows to attack the enemy, and its power could scale along with the power of the handler. \n\nAt the beginning of her journey, Wanwan heard a piece of astonishing news - The Black Dragon wanted to destroy the Dragon Altar and dominate the Cadia Riverlands. Wanwan couldn’t believe that the once closest friend would do such a thing. She decided to find the Black Dragon and seek out the truth.",

In their long history, the Sarmi Tribe and the Bears shared their land. Having a common ancestor, they never attacked each other and lived in harmony. As time passed, they developed a spiritual bond. Such peace was maintained for a long time. \n\nNobody would have thought that the perilous natural environment of the Northern Vale would still invite invaders to this land. Large numbers of pirates from the Frozen Sea came to the Northern Vale. They brought not only endless plunder but also bitter wars. Formidable as they were, the pirates pillaged and occupied this land. As if that was not enough, the invaders started to hunt the Bears. Every tribe of Northern Vale was threatened by those invaders - some of them were conquered, some of them were expelled from their homes, having to struggle homeless in the cold. As the leader of Sarmi Tribe, Masha protected her tribal from waves of attacks. As a tribal hunter, she had a great talent in battle, and this was the reason why she could defend the dignity of the Northern Vale. \n\nShe never forgot the vow of Sarmi - to \"Protect the Bears!\" She endeavored to find the Bears. But when she found the habitat of the Bears, she found only death and signs of violence everywhere. Suddenly, Marsha heard a loud roar. It was a familiar roar. As expected, there was a group of invaders trying to hunt down the Bear King, who was constantly saying \"Beast Power\". They launched attacks with their advanced weapons and unique hunting skills. The Bear King tried to protect the injured little bears by shielding them with his body, though he had been badly hurt by those iron spears. Masha dashed into the battlefield to assist the Bear King, but was in vain. The Bear King perceiving Masha's intentions, decided to divert the attention of those hunters by moving away. Masha understood the purpose of the Bear King and rescued the little bears and ran into the mountains. \n\nShe used her own cloth to bind the wounds sustained by the bears and placed them safely in a secret cave. She went back to assist the Bear King who was gravely injured. Those hunters beat him down and tried to capture him. This irritated Masha who descended upon them and tore them up while attempting to save the Bear King. The Bear King then mustered all his remaining strength and unleashed his final \"Beast Power\". Masha and the Bear King fought together and let the hunters pay in blood for their invasion. It was the first time the Sarmi and the Bears fought together, and the victory belonged to all of Northern Vale. What Masha didn't expect was that the Bear King was down to his final moments. Masha could feel the grateful trust from the Bear King's eyes. It seemed that the King was showing his deepest respect for what she had done. Finally, the King closed his eyes and endowed Masha with powerful energy. Masha felt this energy coursing through her body and she realized that this was the \"Beast Power\". Her body became extremely powerful. It seemed that she could withstand any kind of attack with this body and could beat any opponent with her superb attack speed. \n\nMasha successfully saved the little bears, in hopes that the bears would rise again in future. From that day onwards, Marsha vowed to guard the Northern Vale with her \"Beast Power\" and no invaders would escape the wrath of her wild fists.",

                        "tale": "In the east of the Land of Dawn, between the old village Stream Valley and the Scarlet Shadow, a huge totem ruin stands among the mountains and forests. Some believe that it symbolizes a kind of faith or, as an oracle claimed, is guarding the land. Not far from it, there are mysterious stone steps covered by some leaves. The winding stone steps reach to the sky. Its destination is the Land of Xuan'ao, also known as the Land of Mystic Tortoise.\n\nIn a hundred-mile radius, the stone land is fringed by a cloud forest with an enormous shadow sitting in the center. It seems that he is cultivating himself. Meditation makes one keep away from disputes. However, the cloud begins to grow gloomy. There is a feeling of tension in the air. Suddenly, dozens of chains penetrate the clouds and some assassins land on the stone land. There is a word on their masks, \"Cyan\". They want to lock Baxia with their chains. Fortunately, with the protection of his steel shield made with black ore, Baxia can safely release his power. Those assassins are beaten down, moaning in anguish. However, when one of these assassins mentions \"Cyan Finch\", Baxia is astonished. He knows that it is the name of the best assassin of the Cadia Riverlands and how powerful he is. He knows that Cyan Finch is on his way to kill the Great Dragon. Baxia realizes that he must make an important decision now. This causes him to recall the unforgettable war that occurred hundreds of years ago.\n\n\"Peace makes people weak, only fighting can awaken the inner courage!\" He vaguely remembers that this was once the life motto of Black Dragon. Baxia and Black Dragon used to be perfect mates when they were apprentices of the Great Dragon. Black Dragon had a great talent, and no matter how hard Baxia trained himself, he couldn't become as good as him. However, the man he most admired went astray. Black Dragon dreamt of traveling out from the Hidden Land of Dragons. He wanted to adventure around the world and make people accept the Dragons. Gradually, his dream also affected Baxia. However, although they were so close, Baxia was still weaker than Black Dragon. Black Dragon often snuck away from the Hidden Land of Dragons to go explore the world. Baxia was often blamed by the Great Dragon for assisting Black Dragon. One day, Black Dragon came back to the Hidden Land with a different spirit. He changed, both internally and externally. He was no longer the same as he used to be. The thing that the Great Dragon worried came to pass. Black Dragon became possessed by evil. Baxia could feel his intention of killing. Black Dragon violated the Great Dragon's orders and launched attacks. The betrayal of Black Dragon irritated Baxia. In a critical moment in the war between Black Dragon and the Great Dragon, Baxia knocked Black Dragon out of the clouds and protected his master. Black Dragon disappeared. Baxia still remembered Black Dragon's eyes at that moment and the voice that arose in the sky - \"I will come back!\"\n\nNow Black Dragon has assigned his best assassins to kill the Great Dragon. Baxia doesn't want this to happen. Baxia feels conflicted with his choice, saving his master who he is indebted to by confronting someone who was once his closest brother. Baxia tries to force the assassins' leader to tell him where Black Dragon is, but these assassins refuse to say anything and commit suicide by taking poison. Baxia wants to go back to the Hidden Land of Dragons as soon as possible to assist his master and make up for the errors of his ways.",

Sudden explosions and pungent magical potions make the place a horrible \"Haunted House\". Few will come here, and no one is willing to befriend the dark magicians.The once brilliant black magicians are hard to find now. As a descendant of dark magicians, Lylia has a quirky character and unparallel magical creativity. According to historical records of the Magic Academy, Lylia’s parents were the highest authority among the dark magicians and the pioneers in the creation of the Academy. However, due to the destructive power and particularity of black magic, Lylia’s parents were forced to leave the Magic Academy a long time ago. Lylia grew up alone and was often misunderstood because of her identity as a black magician. At too many thrilling moments, people called her \"Little Witch\" in a not-that-friendly way. Lylia really wants to prove herself. She wants friends, and to be recognized, like other magicians. Lylia offered to help her classmates. For example, when Eudora needed lightning magic, she used a black magic lightning rod to help Eudora create a larger lightning strike. But her “help” eventually led to Eudora being wounded. On another occasion, Harley wanted to improve his magic ability, so Lylia practiced black magic on Harley's Magic Hat. Again, Harley was hurt by the black magic. No matter how she tried, it was impossible for her to get rid of the name. The magicians of the Magic Academy regard Lylia as \"trouble.\" Over time, Lylia came to accept such an identity and behaved like a real \"troublemaker\". But her obsession with black magic never changed; she knows that black magic is omnipotent and capable of docking different spaces – connecting the real world to any time in the past or in the future. She wants to become the greatest dark magician, and she wants to meet her parents. This wish drives her to fight on despite repeated setbacks to find the most powerful black magic. Lylia has tried to use dark magic to crack the time gap, hoping to find the \"critical moment\". Unfortunately, each cracking brought meteorites or other creatures from alien worlds. Lylia is not reconciled; she keeps deploying her magical energy, hoping to find the most stable way.  Until recently, when Lylia found a strange creature from the torn cracks with black magic – the Snores, a kind of void monster who enjoyed devouring magic. When Lylia practiced dark magic, Snores almost completely filled the lab. They reproduced themselves at an alarming rate. They were so loyal to Lylia that every instruction of Lylia was responded to in time. For the first time, Lylia felt that she has many lovely friends. But these strange creatures were getting increasingly greedy. Lylia had an idea. She opened the door of the underground lab. Snores swarmed out, looking for all kinds of magical energy. Lylia looked at the \"disaster\" with an imperceptible smile. The \"trick\" indicated that the greatest black magician of the Magic Academy has finally returned. Magicians, are you ready?",

It was believed that he would lead the Moniyan Empire in unifying the Land of Dawn. The Empire Nobles gave everything to the prince. \n\nOn the day of prince’s first birthday he was found dead in his baby bed blanketed in blood. The room was covered with claw marks and the guards in charge of protecting the prince were also found dead. Sorrow engulfed the whole Moniyan Empire. The hope of the Empire had fallen and, to this day, there has never been such an inspiring prince. Some people believed the prince was killed by the Demons, while others still hoped the Prince was alive. The Empire Nobles appointed the Imperial Knights and the Monastery of Light to find out the truth. At the same time, the Son of Darkness was “born” too... \n\nAfter several years, something strange appeared in the Southern Hills of the Moniyan Empire. In the deepest part of the Abyss, Thamuz, the Lord Lava, watched a special battle. In this glorious battle, the monsters fought with each other until the strongest emerged. He not only possessed the best Evil Gene but also proved to be the strongest fighter in the Demons. \n\nAlice embraced the beloved fighter and recalled the \"Royal Plan\" that she had carried out. He was a masterpiece for her. He mastered Alice's trick, deception, and military strategy. He also learned combat from Thamuz. Now, the Son of Darkness is a capable assistant for the Abyss. He will represent the Lord of the Abyss, fighting against the Moniyan Empire, implementing the “Dawn Plan”, and destroying the “Shining Spark” of the Empire.",

                        "tale": "At the top of the mountains enshrouded by clouds, lies the entrance to the Hidden Land of the Dragon – the “Sky Arch”. Beside the Sky Arch stood many assassins in black. The cyan embroidery etched on their clothes identified them to being part of the most mysterious assassin faction of the Cadia Riverlands, the “Finch”. Legends say, it’s impossible to escape from claws of the “Finch”.\n\nAfter a while, a man landed beside the Sky Arch. With his lithe footwork, he didn’t create any ripples on the lake of clouds. This man was the Finch’s best assassin known as the “Cyan Finch”. Without hesitation, he swung his Defiant Sword, generating great energy and opening the Sky Arch. The assassins behind him dashed across the arch and entered the Hidden Land of the Dragon. As a perfect assassin, Cyan Finch couldn’t tolerate failure. This time was the same. However, the Hidden Land had many occult traps and enchantments to resist invaders, which made the assassins to lose their wings and fall from the sky. Even so, those traps could not stop Cyan Finch at all. His light feet glided over the perils and past into the Hidden Land.\n\nCyan Finch quickly got to the core of the Hidden Land – the Great Dragon Palace. All the guards were attracted by the turmoil on the Sky Arch, and hence left the Palace undefended. He overlooked this palace from high point, recalling the time when he was called “Ling”, when he was betrayed. At that time, Ling and Zilong dwelled in the Hidden Land, receiving the Great Dragon’s training. To become the successor of the Great Dragon was their common goal. However, though the talent Ling defeated Zilong in the final contest, the Great Dragon still chosen Zilong as his successor and his foster son.\n\nLing left the Hidden Land in disgrace and an unsettled heart. Consumed with hatred and the need for power, he fanatically trained himself. His efforts paid off several years later and he became the best assassin and to be later known as Cyan Finch. His enemies even would tremble at hearing his name. Well-known as he was, he still was not satisfied. He needed something to fulfill the void in his heart. One day, he encountered the Black Dragon, a traitor who was banished from the Hidden Land. He proposed a scheme to take revenge on the Hidden Land and Cyan Finch accepted the offer as they both had faced a similar deceit.\n\nLing looked at the Great Dragon sitting in the Palace ominously, and in an instant, he appeared in the center of the Palace. The Great Dragon stared at his once apprentice, shaking his head and sighing. Ling didn’t do anything as he was waiting for his true opponent to come. With a silver flicker, Zilong appeared in the way between Ling and the Great Dragon with his Dragon Spear in hand. This was the moment Ling, now as the Cyan Finch, was waiting for – the moment to settle the score and to prove the Great Dragon wrong. The time the Defiant Sword and the Dragon Spear clashed and a great wave of energy filled the Palace. They fought for hundreds of rounds, from inside to outside. However, they couldn’t best each other.\n\nLing found that Zilong was not the weak foe he once defeated. Frustrated with this, Ling mustered all his power to cast his deadliest skill - “Tempest of Blades”. Its great energy shook the entire Hidden Land. Zilong held his ground in the center of the Sword Field without fear. Zilong wielded his Dragon Spear and pursued Ling’s sword like an unyielding dragon. Zilong, powerful as he was, was no match for Ling’s speed and finesse as he found his adversary’s sword pointing at his eye. However, Ling’s hand trembled and hesitated on seeing that Zilong withdrew his spear before it was about to hit him.\n\nThe memory of training together and encouraging each other filled Ling’s heart. Also, Zilong trusted that their friendship could overcome their conflict. All this made Ling withdraw his sword. He realized that what made him confuse was not the choice made by the Great Dragon, but rather it was the reason why Zilong allowed himself to be defeated. Zilong chose to trust the one who had missing for years and dropped his guard. Just like that decisive battle, Zilong chose to be defeated by him in order to help Ling achieve his dream. Ling knew in his heart that this was the last chance to fight fairly with Zilong.\n\nZilong knew that Ling’s confusion had been resolved and Ling could now fly through the sky like a real Cyan Finch. However, Zilong also knew that Ling’s raid indicated the coming of the true crisis - The Black Dragon was coming.",

It's a priceless treasure, even when based on countless failures. For overwhelming technology, people are willing to sacrifice a great deal. The Eruditio, located in the north-west of the Land of Dawn, was the symbol of the highest intelligence. They made all that was impossible possible. Glorious and honorable as it may be, rebellion and hostility grow in the background of it all.\n\nRecently, a series of explosions became the headache of the Erudition. All the clues and evidence pointed that the culprits were none other than their arch rival, the Magic Academy. For the safety and dignity of the Eruditio, Bruno leads the Eruditio Rangers to find the criminal who caused the explosions. On the very moment of their departure, Dr. Rooney shows up and stops them. Apologetic and full of regret, Dr. Rooney unfolds a secret of the past.\n\nThere was once a peaceful small town near the Eruditio. One day, a technological experiment was carried out in the town. Everything went on smoothly until the final unexpected explosion terminated the fantasy. All the innocent townsfolk were devoured by the flame in an instant. No cries, no screams. The explosion was horrible and fast enough to cover every living creature under ashes. The Eruditio immediately sent out ambulances and emergency response teams to save the townsfolk. Unfortunately, only X.Borg survived, with his body severely injured. The Eruditio managed to remake his body so that X.Borg could live on. However, X.Borg could never forget the scenes of everyone's helplessness and desperation in the flames. Finally, he ran away from the Eruditio. Years later, coming back to his hometown, X.Borg found that the old houses of his forgotten town had been rebuilt into a technology dump. Feeling familiar and strange to this place, he gradually lost his temper. All he could think about was destroying the technology of the Eruditio. He resided in the dump, making use of the unwanted materials and transforming his body into an explosive weapon. He, however, knew clearly that he himself was not able to fight against the entire Eruditio, therefore he tried to create conflict between the Eruditio and the Magic Academy. Every time when the Eruditio held a celebration or announced a new invention, X.Borg was in the shadows causing chaos. He held the belief that not every technological development was beneficial to the world. He would find his own methods to destroy the Eruditio.",

Deep in the Monastery stands an iron cage, called \"the door to rebirth.\" Within this cage, hides the dark and secret history of the Empire.\n\nWhen the guards opened the lock, all they could see were startling sentences written on the wall: \"Break the BELIEF\" \"It's time to pay ten years off\" \"The world should be enshrouded in darkness!\". Suddenly the cryptic news went around the entire Moniyan Empire - Terizla escaped!\n\nFeeling reborn, Terizla stops walking, and takes a deep breath of fresh air; enjoying the freedom while his eyes remain closed. Suddenly, his body begins to hurt as if he were being punched by thousands of needles, and his veins begin to bulge around his eyes. His skin turned pale. There are only two emotions he can feel right now: pain and rage. Half-conscious, he loses control of his actions. He accidentally sees his ugly face, and old memories come flooding back into his head - It was indeed, a disaster.\n\nTerizla was once the leader of the smiths in a small village near the Moniyan Empire. They could insert life into swords; thus, with the help of these powerful weapons, even a common soldier could slay some of the strongest enemies. Soon, they received good graces from the Empire. The emperor sent out envoys under the name of \"Belief in the Lord of Light.\" The emperor asked the smiths to surrender the Empire, mimicking the tradition of instruction passed down through generations. Terizla kindly refused them. Baffled by his decision and repeated refusal to surrender, the Empire paid them a visit with a bloody surprise. All their blueprints were robbed, and all the smiths were wiped from history.\n\nTerizla was captured in the Monastery of Light and was forced to endure many experiments. He was suffering mostly from the experiment, \"Rebirth\", which made the death of the other smiths seemed appealing. His memories kept being cleared, but Terizla knew that someday the Empire would pay for what they had done. \n\nConsumed by rage and misery, Terizla feels once again that his head would break apart any time. Suddenly, he is surrounded by a warm feeling, and a cute girl is standing in front of him. \"Don't fight it. Let the hatred spread and explode in this land! If you need any help, remember me - Abyssal Witch.\" His body no longer paining, Terizla calms down, confused and pensive.\n\nAfter a while, Terizla shows a hint of a smile. Staring at the Moniyan Empire far away, he knows that the real danger for the Empire is just about to arrive.",

To become an astrologer, candidates should pass rigorous assessments, which will test both their willpower and astrological abilities. Going down the generations, the elders finally select Esmeralda, a young girl living in the Western Desert, to be the new successor in the Land of Dawn. \n\nAfter becoming the successor of the astrologers, Esmeralda guards the Starmoon Casket that has been passed down for generations. With the hope of opening it and gaining the mysterious power from the ancient times, Esmeralda leaves off to the Minos Labyrinth to find the secrets of the Starmoon Casket. But unfortunately, on her way to the Minos Labyrinth, the ground suddenly shakes and the desert falls into pieces, followed by a black sandstorm. All of a sudden, the Starmoon Casket opens and a stream of mysterious power fills in Esmeralda. Under the protection of the mysterious power, Esmeralda gets no harm and feels old memories flashing back through her mind. She feels the Starmoon Casket is calling for her, reminding her that Khufra, the ruthless tyrant of the Western Desert long ago, has recovered himself. Following the lead of the Starmoon Casket, Esmeralda changes direction to the deep desert, where there stands an ancient city. After the Starmoon Casket opens, two streams of power coming from it begin centering around Esmeralda - \"Frostmoon\", enriched with magic, and \"Stardust\", filled with great power. Impressed by the might of the Starmoon Casket, which was only spoken of in tales before, Esmeralda recalls the memories from the first generation of astrologers. When Esmeralda approaches the ancient city, she vaguely feels an unknown love story between Khufra and some astrologer. Seeing the end of their love, Esmeralda somehow feels sad and sorry. But it's her mission to seal Khufra and return the peace to the Western Desert.",

The most prestigious skill of theirs, fencing, the family's forte, discourages countless opponents from even thinking about attacking. In addition, beauty and wisdom are also the most perfect genetic signs of the Baroque family, just like the eternal beauty and love of Violet. \n\n World-famous as Baroque family's fencing is, young Guinevere doesn't like it at all. Just like other girls, she is naturally fond of gorgeous things. From youth, she was sent to the Magic Academy. Relying on her own sensitive spiritual perception and anti-gravity magic, when Guinevere was 10 years old, she successfully combined mental perception with super energy and invented multiple magic effects - magic superpower. Such a breakthrough made Guinevere more passionate about magic, and she often experimented with her new magic on her brother Lancelot. No matter how Lancelot hid, he would always be found by his sister. Therefore, Lancelot was often caught in out of nowhere. During his childhood, his sister was always causing him headaches, but Lancelot still loves Guinevere. He always shows a smile to his beloved sister. But every time Lancelot thinks of his little sister's magic experiment, he would wear a bitter smile. \n\n Recently, something has been plaguing Guinevere, making her uneasy. It is said that the Paxley nobles who have a very high magical status have proposed marriage to the Baroque family. Guinevere is undoubtedly the most suitable choice and Guinevere's father seems to be very willing to go through with the marriage. But the reluctant Guinevere suddenly thinks of an idea - She hopes to find her brother Lancelot...",

Everyone just called him “the vagrant poet, Granger”. \n\nGranger was orphaned during the war between the Moniyan Empire and the Southern Mountains. He was picked up by the Imperial Army, then sent to the Monastery of Light. Similar to all orphans, Granger was silent and isolated. He never showed many feelings through his cold eyes. Only when the melody of violins emerged in the monastery would Granger show any interest in anything, getting lost until the music ended. \n\nEvery orphan in the monastery had two options for their future as adults: to be a demon hunter, living by completing the secret tasks assigned by the Empire, or to be a servant of the monastery, doing the cleaning and washing for a lifetime. To everyone’s surprise, Granger chose guns and violins at the same time, meaning that he would choose both options. More precisely, he would choose neither of them. He abhorred war and demons, to which he lost his family and home, thus he wouldn’t hesitate to be a hunter. Violins, however, meant a lot to him as they soothed his misery and nightmares. \n\nGranger enjoyed music. He would turn a beautiful piece of music to a prelude of battle. In his own words, \"It excites me.\" Since he received his violin, Granger played lousy music wherever he went. The noise from the violins would be so bad that his opponents would lose focus. Granger would take this opportunity to shoot his enemies with his gun before they could realize it’s a trap. Soon after, he took the lead among the demon hunters. Even the S-Level Tasks were not a big deal to him. Impressed by his efficiency and abilities, Alucard, one of the most well-known demon hunters, admired and respected Granger. \n\nThe news about Granger soon spread among the demons. As soon as anyone heard a horribly sad melody, they would escape with haste - otherwise, it would not end up well for them. After all, a painful death awaits...",

Despite ages passing by, the desert sands were unable to devour this city, which stands proud and majestic in a sea of emptiness. Scholars of antiquities have long spoke of this fabled city, whose most infamous ruler was none other than Khufra.\n\nKhufra was a greedy ruler, colder than ice, and avaricious to limitless extents. In order to satisfy his personal desire to rule, he led the powerful army of Arnak to invade the city to conquer the Western Desert. Tirelessly, Khufra expanded his domain and riches beyond compare. Unfortunately, the Minoan Empire proved to be too difficult of a foe to conquer. \n\n Even so, Khufra longed for more power. He sought the most famous astrologer in the Land of Dawn to help himself. Much to Khufra's dismay, the astrologer knew of Khufra's insidious goals and declined and was swiftly slain. Only the young Eslora felt deeply attracted to Khufra, who then became lovers. Khufra's callousness sent Eslora into a mess of internal conflict and love. Gradually, Eslora deeply loved Khufra and began to help Khufra with his rule. Over time, Eslora used her magical abilities to grant Khufra magical powers that were never before seen. However, Khufra became even more and more cruel and hungry for power. His conquests did not end with the Western Desert, he sought to conquer the entire Land of Dawn. Seeing the cruelty of her love, Eslora decided to save Khufra from the hate of the people. \n\n Even then, Khufra continued to use magic to enhance his powers. He asked Eslora to give all the spells to him. He must completely eliminate the Minoan Empire. No one could question his power. One night, Eslora came to Khufra and she deeply embraced her lover. She began to place Khufra under a powerful curse, while Khufra was expecting the ultimate power given by Eslora. Suddenly, Khufra felt suppressed by a powerful force. He turned his head and looked at Eslora. No matter how Khufra tried to break free, Eslora did not stop chanting her curse. Khufra could not believe that his lover was punishing him. Eslora wept as she bound her love into an eternal slumber. She chose to personally seal her lover in the ancient city and built a grand monument. Eslora believed it was better to end Khufra before he became despised by the people, going down in history as the cruel king who loved nothing but power. Since then, the smoke of the war in the Western Desert disappeared. \n\n However, hundreds of years later, a cataclysmic event occurred in the Western Desert. A wave of energy from an orb awakened Khufra from his slumber, who swelled with hatred and anger. Returning to the world, Khufra could not accept the betrayal of his lover in the past. His abilities and desires were stronger than ever before. He vowed to find Eslora and continue to pursue the centuries-old wish to possess the Land of Dawn within his hands.",

Among them was a strong man, named Badang. Enthusiastic and brave, he tirelessly helped everyone solve their difficulties in life. \n\nHowever, a strange thing happened in the village not long ago. The villagers got up early every day to catch fish. In the evening, they returned empty-handed, even the tools for fishing were broken. Everyone was upset, thinking it was the curse of a mystical water monster. As food supplies ran low, Badang decided to give them a hand to find out the truth. He did not believe in the water monster. \n\nIn the early morning, Badang went out to fish as usual. He came to the river near the village to set up a fishing trap. He not only placed a lot of fish, but also hid it with a giant fishing net prepared in advance, trying to find out who or what was causing the village's problems. Shortly after, the river suddenly began to bubble, and a strange creature in the river appeared next to his trap. Devil-like and fearsome, it began to steal the fish and destroy the trap. Its eyes were fiery, with long hair and a long beard. Badang decisively threw a giant fishing net, trying to trap the monster. However, the monster pierced the fishing net with its giant teeth and started to break free. It constantly attacked him, but the fearless Badang jumped into battle with this fearsome beast without hesitation. The power of this monster was surprisingly strong and Badang's arms were severely injured. When the beast was about to devour Badang, he used his remaining strength to insert the fishing spear into its body, and then pulled it to the river shore. After leaving the river, the monster gradually lost its moisture and began to dry. It couldn't breathe for long. Badang had never seen such a creature. \n\nBadang noticed a magical gem sparkling in its body. Struggling to speak, the water monster begged Badang to let it go, swearing it was the elf who lived in the river but suffered a horrible transformation. Once the beast headed to the southern mountains to prey on the fish but accidentally ate fish corrupted by evil energy. As it spoke, the beast's body gradually began to change. The water beast began to regurgitate all the fish it consumed, along with the evil energy. Having returned to its natural state, the water elf deeply appreciated Badang. \n\nAfter that, Badang got a stream of powerful energy and his injured arms were also restored and were way more powerful than before. Badang's kind heart drove him to finally let go of the monster. Badang started helping the villagers day and night, whose lives slowly returned to normal. However, Badang couldn't let go of the southern mountains that the monster spoke of. For the safety of his village, Badang was determined to find the source of the evil energy within the mountains and travelled across the islands, towards the Land of Dawn.",

Unfortunately, the castle collapsed overnight, as if it had suddenly disappeared. The tall gray walls were covered with dark black vines, which were more horrifying and strange under the moonlight. The breath of death makes the creatures close to this ancient building shudder and keep away. It seemed that the owner of the castle had set up a trap, waiting for prey to fall for it. \n\n A man wearing feathers stood on a distant hill, looking at this deadly castle. He silently read the name of the castle, \"Necrokeep\". He tried to recall the memories of the past, only to be filled with pain over all his body. This pain awakened his inner hatred. As the most prominent magician of the time, Faramis was the only survivor of the disaster. \n\n A few years ago, the Queen of this castle - Vexana cursed her soul to save the fallen king, her husband. After gaining the ability to dominate the abyss, the whole castle was shrouded in dark energy, and the country was in chaos. Regardless of Faramis's efforts to save Vexana, she still didn't get better. Faramis kept trying all kinds of methods, hoping to cure the corrupted kingdom. Over time, it did nothing to alleviate the disease. On the contrary, Vexana gradually became eroded by this energy and became a full-fledged monster. Gradually this terrible rumor spread throughout the Land of Dawn. \n\n The Moniyan Empire led the army to capture this place. For the peace of the mainland, the Imperial Knights had to destroy all the infected people here. Faramis pleaded with the Empire, but was rejected by the Empire. Instead, the imperial knights ignored the infected lives, and chained Faramis in a heavily guarded laboratory, Faramis could only watch the whole castle being smeared with charcoal, when the army of the empire retired three days afterwards, Faramis climbed out of the ruins of the castle miraculously. The castle was already unrecognizable. In order to survive, Faramis found the magic book of his life record in the ruins. \n\n In the days of exile, he tested crazy dark magic on himself, constantly exploring the ways he could live within his own body and creating more aggressive magic. The years of suffering had also turned him into a vengeful creep who had never forgotten any of the warriors of the empire. With the book of resurrection in hand, he understood that he was using forbidden and unkonwn magic. Still, the chains in his body reminded him of the suffering from the empire, pushing him to plot against the Empire for the rest of his life...",

Admired by everyone, Kadita was considered by all to be genuine, intelligent, and kind-hearted. However, fate often times finds its way to hit people with strife. Kadita was no different. As the heir apparent to the king, a member within the royal family grew jealous of Kadita and conspired to ruin her — An unknown mage wielding the power of black magic viciously attacked the princess. Kadita came under a powerful spell that robbed her of all her beauty, giving her a strange skin disease in the process.\n\nThe kingdoms people tried everything they could think of to help their beloved princess, but no one could break the spell. Overtime, people's love for Kadita faded, causing her to lose power and confidence. Out of tremendous despair, Kadita threw herself into the stormy Southern Seas. However, Kadita was rescued by the ocean demons. Using the trident of the seas, the ocean demons were able to break Kadita's powerful spell, but due to her skin disease her skin was never able to return to its original complexion. On that day, Kadita become the legendary Queen of the Southern Seas. \n\nAssuming all new powers, Kadita became adept at controlling the ocean waters and the weather. Sailors from all corners of the world came to fear the Southern Seas as they were bound to suffer the wrath of Kadita — No one dared to conquer the Southern Seas any longer. Survivors recant their experiences facing Kadita. Some say she had the appearance of a strange mermaid, while others said she was more beautiful than the princess they knew before. As stories of Kadita began to spread, legends say that she possesses seven legendary spears, each with its own unique abilities, used to punish any invaders who intended to violate the Southern Seas. \n\nAs the story goes, Kadita collected the seven spears while guarding the Southern Seas. No one has the power to use all seven spears at once, except for Kadita.",

He was once the Prince of Mahar Pura and served in the Forces from his youth. After adulthood he was respectfully called one of the \"Four Great Generals\" of Mahar Pura with his remarkable achievements. \n\n Minsitthar was invincible in wars, which earned the trust of the King and his people. They deeply believed that Minsitthar would be the King after his Father. Perseverant and courageous as he might be, yet he couldn't avoid falling for an unacceptable love, and it enraged his Father and dried out all the trust and expectation towards his son. Minsitthar knew that he had made an unrecoverable mistake and fled out of the Palace in the dark night with his servants. \n\n It was the first time that he left his homeland. But his exile had just begun. Years flew by when Minsitthar heard that his Father had passed away and his kingdom was in great danger. When he was hesitating whether he should stand out and save the kingdom, the messenger of his brother found him. He tried to persuade Minsitthar to come back and help them. Minsitthar and his brother had some disagreement in battlefield strategies, and his paranoid brother failed in his own plan and got killed by the rebelling army. Minsitthar united the soldiers and slayed all the enemies with the Holy Spear his Father passed down to him. Mahar Pura was in peace again. \n\n Shortly after, Minsitthar stepped onto the throne and became the new king of Mahar Pura. During the exile he had witnessed many methods of ruling and he brought revolution and innovation to his kingdom. Soon later Mahar Pura became a prosperous kingdom again.",

The stories often depict this cat-like race as small in stature, agile, playful, independent, and highly intelligent. However, few are aware of the longstanding alliance between the Leonin Elves and the Moon Elves. \n\nFrom a young age, Harith surpassed his peers in talent and wisdom. He quickly became the strongest mage among the Leonins, perhaps as strong as others in the Land of Dawn. Although, the Leonins never step foot outside of the Enchanted Forest, living a peaceful and safe life on their own. The Leonins became so complacent with their blissful existence that they no longer pursued the magic arts, a hallmark of their people. Harith became very discontent with this trend and confidently set out of the Enchanted Forest to see the outside world at the young age of 15. Harith was driven by his ambition and passion for the magic arts, aspiring to become his people's leader in magic. \n\nHarith arrived the Land of Dawn's capital, where he joined human armies to fight off the invading orc tribes. Proving himself in battle, Harith gained the recognition of Tigreal, who came to appreciate Harith's lively spirit and strong abilities. People say, Harith was given the rank of lieutenant and will soon be appointed as an Imperial Master of Magic of the Moniyan Empire. With that said, Harith has imperial authorization to use magic to control space and time to unlock the Secrets of Dawn. Since then, Harith proudly served on an expedition through the Land of Dawn to seal away evil and protect justice. \n\nFull of excitement and fervor, Harith also knew that once he is appointed the title of Master of Magic that he will become a target of public criticism. Committed to his dream of becoming his people's leader in magic, Harith fearlessly marched forward alone. Over time, Harith discovered that his life was consumed by his mission and by the empire. Harith slowly grew lonely and reclusive. Even when he met his fellow Leonin, Nana, he was unable to maintain a normal conversation. Despite Nana showing signs of affection towards him, he could not express his feelings, believing that the best way to protect her from criticism was for him to be alone. After all, whenever the empire needed magical assistance, the Master of Magic was on the job to seal away the dangers of evil.",

Since the beginning of the abyss's reign on the mainland, countless demons became loyal followers of the Abyss. Fervent in their beliefs, the demons chant the will of the Abyss in these deep caverns — Only the strong deserve to rule! \n\nGuarding the Abyss for millenniums, a tribe of fire demons nearly became the rulers of the Abyss. Thamuz, the king of the fire demons, and his people made the Abyss into a formidable power. He was an excellent warrior, with a fierce temper, unabashed to use cruel methods in achieving his goals. Possessing ungodly natural strength, Thamuz was appointed chief of the abyss, who led the abyss to conquer all of the underworld. \n\nTo Thamuz, all of his opponents were worthless scum, unworthy of living in this world. In his eyes, only he was worthy to lead. Thamuz could not accept the Blood Demon, Alice, as her bloodline was not pure — thus, unworthy to command and enter war.\n\nWith the gates to the Abyss about to open, legions of demons eagerly await Thamuz's return. However, once the King of Fire Demons returns he will burn away all the weak demons—Only the strong deserve to be a part of the Abyssal Army. Thamuz has been waiting for the day he leads the Abyssal Army across the Land of Dawn to let it be known — Only the strong shall reign!",

As a result, Kimmy developed a tomboy-ish character which everyone could see, be it in the way she dressed or in the way she spoke. Since childhood, Kimmy possessed a natural talent for research and innovation. Kimmy was always keen on analyzing and reforming chemical energies. \n\nHowever, her father felt differently about his daughter's passions. He wanted her daughter to completely stay away from war and everything related to the military and to live life like a normal person. Like all the teenagers, she rebelled against her father. In her opinion, except for the mechanical technology from the Eruditio and the mystifying magic power of the Magic Academy, a fusion of biotic and chemical energy could be the solution to many problems in the Land of Dawn. Over time, Kimmy's interests drove a wedge between her and her father. \n\nBeyond the minor quarrels between Kimmy and her father, Kimmy had achieved many great things. She had a passtion for creating new inventions. She believes that the shooting backpack she invented could finally make sense one day. Kimmy decided to take her inventions and enroll in the Empire Army to prove to her father that she was right.",

Within his ancient self, Belerick possesses a strong life force that provides strong resistance against attacks and also allows him to reincarnate. Due to his kind nature, wherever there is conflict, Belerick will be there to help the righteous and weak. \n\nOne day, Belerick believed he heard the words of the ancient ones guiding him towards the desert. However, he was met with disaster. The great Minoan empire was left in ruins and Minotaur people were filled with despair. In order to save what was left of the Minoans, Belerick unleashed all of his life force to create a beautiful oasis. The Minoan people were filled with hope once more. Seeing this, Belerick's heart was at peace and fell into a deep slumber. Although Belerick can not pursue the task the Ancient Ones bestowed upon him, he felt no regret—There's nothing more important than life after all.",

In order to reach the pinnacle of ninja arts, the Akakages used a forbidden ninjutsu to rid their hearts of evil, anger, and greed by condensing them into a demon called, Hanekage. No one expected that Hanekage would have consciousness, despite lurking within their bodies.\n\nWhen the legendary One Hundred Ghosts attacked the House of Akakage, the demon within them merged with the ghosts to become a single entity. Thus began a bloody feud between the Akakage and the powerful demon, Hanekage. At a grave cost, the Akakage used the ninjutsu, Blood Shadow, to temporarily seal the demon. In order to permanently seal Hanekage, the Akakages used their sacred tools to create a legendary sword, known as Ame no Habakiri. Not long after, the forefathers of the Akakage perished from the world. Their grieving disciples hid Ame no Habakiri in an unknown place that only members of the Akakage family could reach. Little did the Akakage know, the cunning Goddess of Death, Izanami, observed these events and secretly inserted a part of her soul in one of their progeny to one day resurrect Hanekage. \n\nAfter many generations, the House of Akakage was divided into the Crimson and Shadow factions. The Shadow Faction gave birth to strongest Akakage the clan has ever seen — Hanzo. As one would expect, Hanzo became the head of the Shadow Faction.\n\nHowever, one day, Hanzo's team discovered his secret. All this time, Hanzo secretly fused Hanekage's power with his own body, feeding the demon with the blood of his enemies. When confronted by the Akakage's Crimson Faction, Hanzo killed them all in cold blood. Absorbing the blood of such powerful people, Hanekage regained consciousness once again. \n\nHanekage told Hanzo that his noble clan hid the powerful Ame no Habakiri, as well as sacred ninjutsu, in a secret location only the Akakage could reach. The power-hungry Hanzo abused his blood right to acquire the forbidden ninjutsu and the fabled sword, Ame no Habakiri. The remaining members of the Akakage furiously chased after the clan's traitor.\n\nEmboldened by the power of Hanekage, Hanzo used his own clan's sword against them and tore the powerful energy from their flesh. Desperate, the two Akakage factions came together once again to take on Hanzo as one. Heavily wounded, the final members of the noble House of Akakage could only watch Hanzo escape. \n\nHanzo secretly took refuge to recover from his injuries. Night and day, Hanzo practiced the Akakage's forbidden ninjutsu with Ame no Habakiri. After a decade, Hanzo could not achieve the pinnacle of ninjutsu like his forefathers. Hanekage consumed the flesh and blood of fallen ninjas and transformed into a magical armor for Hanzo. Hanekage struck a deal with Hanzo. In exchange for feeding Hanekage more blood, the powerful demon will help Hanzo reach the pinnacle of ninjutsu. Possessing the ability to reach the pinnacle of ninjutsu and the Ame no Habakiri, Hanzo brought a bloodbath to the world.",

Her eyes were as deep as the ancient lake. \n\n The mysterious atmosphere she created then put all of the heroes into a dreamland...... The powers of Chaos and Order have been struggling against each other since ancient times, and the struggle had driven the world into desperation. Lunox, the mysterious maiden, is the one who survived the desperation. With her unique talent, she can project her dream into reality and change it. \n\n One day, a sound whispered to her, and told her to balance the two powers with her dreamland ability. But the cost would be larger than ever. For the world she loves, she accepted this fate, channeled the two powers into dreamland and became one with the \"Twilight Orb\", at the cost of falling into endless sleep. But the sound also told Lunox that one day, she will wake up to proceed to her fate - to find other Twilight Orbs that have been forgotten by history.",

After this devastating defeat, Vexana realized she needed to find a formidable ally, who could take on the Warrior of Light head on, or else she would face certain defeat. Vexana paced back and forth as she carefully pondered who had the strength to defeat Tigreal. Suddenly, a vivid image of a face from long ago seared across her mind—Leomord. \n\nA long time ago, the Fortress of Despair was actually the center of a beautiful and rich kingdom. Leomord and his Royal Knights vowed an oath to protect their King and the Queen, who was in fact Vexana. Any invader who dared attack the kingdom could not avoid the fate of death by Leomord's sword. However, one day the kingdom came to ruin. That was the day Vexana transformed all of the kingdom's creatures into the undead. Lionhart fell into great despair. Even if he could single-handedly eliminate all of the evil from the kingdom, he could not raise his sword against the women who was once his queen. He could not bear to watch the kingdom he loved and swore to protect fall into ruin. Leomord took his own life out of sorrow and desperation. \n\nLeomord's strength and resolve burned so brightly in life, that Vexana could not control him as a spirit. However, since the Fortress of Despair was met with a great danger, she had no choice but to awaken him. When he rose from the dead, Leomord felt that his soul was filled with torturous amounts of pain and despair. Whispering sweetly into his ear, Vexana told Leomord that the undead that stood before him were once the beloved people he swore to protect. She warned that if he did not protect the Fortress of Despair, then all of these innocent souls would suffer eternal damnation. \n\nLeomord had no choice. He would rather be a slave to Vexana's sorcery than watch his compatriots suffer another day. Leomord summoned his beloved horse, Barbiel, and his famed sword, The Oath Keeper. \n\nJust as the Expeditionary Forces of Light stormed the horrific Fortress of Despair, Leomord and Barbiel struck the invaders with black lightening. Much of the Expeditionary Forces of Light were decimated. No one could withstand Leomord's sword, or so they thought. Tigreal stood there in defiance with the Sword of Dawn drawn against Leomord. As their swords clashed, Tigreal could feel Leomord's grief and despair coming from his sword. On that day, Tigreal knew he met one of the strongest opponents he had ever faced.",

If you wish to avenge your cruel father, I do not blame you as long as you can cast away the storm within your heart. Nothing is as important as your happiness, not even my life.\" Vale fell into deep contemplation as he began to write his letter to Valir. Those first few lines brought Vale back to the days of his youth, when he and Valir were the closest of friends. \n\nAs Vale fell further into nostalgia, he remembered the day they met at a royal party. Ever since then, they both felt a strong affinity towards each other's magic. For a long time, Vale and Valir were inseparable. Together, they left many memories in the Valley of the Winds, the Fire Kingdom, and many other exotic lands. When unrest flooded the Fire Kingdom, Valir quickly made his leave. Only Vale knows exactly how much Valir sacrificed that day. \n\nAs time went on, the day of the pact was coming soon. Vale's magical abilities used to control the winds have grown more sophisticated over the years. In fact, he's the only member of his family who can change the winds with magic Yet, Vale has never shown his magic to anyone before. Vale waited and waited for the day of the pact to come. On that day, he would put on a spectacular display of wind magic for Valir. Vale believes that Valir will see his magic, remember the precious times they had together, and return to how things were in their youth.",

His story is a favorite for tipsy travelers—One of the most famous legends in the Land of Dawn. \n\nRumor has it, that this teenage human has a special talent for thievery. To Claude, thievery is an art from rather than a crime. In fact, Claude would often send his victims a notice to let them know in advance. Much to everyone's surprise, Claude always succeeded in acquiring his targeted objects, regardless of how strong or prepared his victims are. \n\nWhether the target is king's a well-guarded treasure, a magic library protected by powerful spells, or an dark fortress filled with the undead—Nothing can stop Claude from taking what he wants. \n\nIt is said that this young \"Thief King\" has a mysterious partner in crime. Some say his partner is a beautiful maiden, other's say it's his twin brother. However, most people believe in the version of the story where Claude's partner is a wizard who practices black magic—This version quickly gained support after one of Claude's victims recalled hearing an odd laughter. \n\nIn recent times, Claude is said to be eyeing the latest research of the famed machine specialist in the city of Antoinerei, Dr. Rooney, who's said to have invented a device that would allow its user to freely travel across the planes of existence and create mirror images.The Captain of the Guard, Bruno, caught wind of Claude's hallmark notice and installed monitoring devices all over Antoinerei to catch him. As soon as Claude entered the city, he was caught by the City Guards and placed in an inescapable prison that utilized some of the best technology. \n\nJust when everyone thought this was the end of the Thief King's reign, Claude's mysterious partner helped him escape from the prison. Not only that, but they also successfully stole Dr. Rooney's new invention from his lab, just as promised on Claude's notice. \n\nAs a triumphant Claude left Antoinerei, he noticed that Dr. Rooney's device had a small note: \n\n\"I hope you make the best use of this device. If you happen to have any ideas for improvement, you must write to me! —Rooney\"",

In the maze is a statue of a giant minotaur, which the people consider to be the mecca of the Minoan Kingdom. Some say that there is a group of mercenaries who guard the entire maze. ??The Kingdom produced a lot of precious jade, which brought the Minoan people great wealth. Very quickly, the entire kingdom was lost in the intoxicating allure of gems. Even many mercaneries, tasked with guarding the sacred maze became corrupted, abandoning their duty. Only one stayed—Aldous, who had never forgotten his duty to guard the Minoan Labyrinth. ??\n\nUntil one day, a god came from the heavens to punish the lands. The powers of light and dark decimated the entire Minoan Kingdom, which even Aldous could not escape. ??Then two streams of energy surged into his body. Aldous thought he was about to die. However, the two streams of energy collided, causing great changes to his body. His skin grew long-black scales that could resist most attacks and monstrously large arms that could easily strike fear into people's hearts. ??\n\nWhen Aldous awoke from his daze, he found his people's kingdom gone but the mysterious maze was now sealed by some unknown force. He and the remaining minotaurs decided that Aldous would stay to defend the maze, while the others travel towards the Land of Dawn to find answers. ??News of a mysterious force sealing the Minoan Maze spread quickly to the Abyssal Kingdom. To gather this strange energy, Selena brought her Abyssal Demons with her to the entrance of the Minoan Maze — A huge battle was about to begin.",

Many misguided believers offer sacrifices to the Abyss, unknowingly feeding the demons, created from dark energy in its purest form, always lurking in the darkness waiting to devour the carcasses of sacrifices.\n\nOne day, Selena, a young dark elf, was sacrificed by fanatic believers in exchange for dark energy. Elves being the demon's favorite sacrifice, Selena was mercilessly thrown into the abyss. The Abyss Demon filled Selena with pain and despair, which coursed through every vein of her young body. Just as Selena was about to be consumed by the darkness, a miracle happened. A mysterious, warm-blue light enveloped her and appeared to be battling with the darkness for control over her body. When Selena woke, she found herself still lying in the Abyss, but her skin was now exuding some strange blue glow, and her once lavender eyes were filled with a majestic scarlet glow. It was the Abyss Demon resting within her. The demons frantically wondered what happened.\n\nThe Will of the Abyss then spoke: \"This girl is loved deeply, and this love has protected her from being consumed by darkness. The abyss and the moon god, two opposing forces, have reached a balance within her body.\" An ancient and deep voice echoed through the minds of the demons, \"Leave this girl to me. She will become the strongest warrior of the Abyss!\" The Demons obeyed the commands and left Selena as she was. When Selena stood before the demonic inhabitants of the abyss, with the Abyssal Demon at her side, she had completely forgotten her past. Selena quickly discovered that she could manipulate the dark magic of the Abyss. She could absorb the power of the Abyss into her body to transform herself into a demoness, capable of tearing her enemies into shreds. The Will of the Abyss appointed her as its voice, giving Selena uncontested rule over the demons of the Abyss. Even Alice, the proud Queen of Blood Magic, felt unsettled when she laid eyes upon the young dark elf—Not only because the Abyss chose Selena, but also because Alice could sense a terrifying power lying within this seemingly-cute and mischievous maiden named, Selena.",

Any demon who dared approach the city would be overwhelmed by their unrivaled flying speed and bound by their frightening lightning whips which would strip their victims of all magical abilities. No demon could escape when pursued by these divine warriors, and thus perpetual peace was maintained in the Celestial Palace. \n\nAs their leader, Kaja was able to refine the power of lighting into pure energy to control as he so desired, inflicting catastrophic damage to all enemies who faced him, and was charged with directly protecting the ruler of the city. Countless eons ago, after the city's ruler created the Nazar guardians and departed, the city gradually fell into a state of ruin. When Uranus was activated, the ruler of the Celestial Palace handed down new orders to the Nazar -- to drive the evil demons from the city and rebuild the Celestial Palace in anticipation of the master's return.",

She exhibited amazing magical potential from an early age, quickly mastering the Great Dragon's greatest spell — The Sacred Satellite. From then on, Chang'e earned the eternal love of the Great Dragon. However, Chang'e's energetic and playful personality gave the Great Dragon quite a few headaches so he finally asked Zilong, his adopted son, to look after Chang'e. The Great Dragon was hopeful that Zilong's diligent and determined character could help guide Chang'e. Solemn as Zilong was, he came to love the lively and intelligent Chang'e as his little sister. They often spent countless hours together practicing magic. Zilong even managed to find the Moon Rabbit as a gift for Chang'e. Zilong was hoping that one day Chang'e would discover the strength of the divine rabbit and with its help improve her magic ability. Chang'e read Zilong's mind and took good care of the Moon Rabbit, accompanying it every day. \n\nDuring the second War of the Planes, Zilong assisted the wise rulers of the land, traveling between worlds. After he left, Chang'e returned to her naughty and childish ways, even the Moon Rabbit did something naughty from time to time. At one point, the Great Dragon was not sure if there would ever be another day of peace—That is, until the Moon Rabbit accidentally swallowed one of his sacred pills, thinking it was candy. The Great Dragon immediately cast the Moon Rabbit out of his sanctuary. To everyone's surprise, the Moon Rabbit rebelled again the Great Dragon. At the very moment of the Great Dragon taking its life, Chang'e saved the Rabbit and decided to assist Zilong and make up for her mistake together with the Moon Rabbit. Even then, the Great Dragon felt compelled to give Chang'e his precious Crescent Moon to protect her.",

This was the very first time the proud Hanabi came across anyone who could hold their own against her. Whenever the moon was full, Hanabi would try to find ways to provoke this young shadow ninja into dueling with her, however, she could never defeat this youngster, who fused spiritualism with shadow techniques to create a unique and powerful style. \n\nAs the two of them slowly grew up together, it began to dawn on Hanabi that this young shadow ninja carried the burden of an inescapable fate -- Hayabusa was in fact destined to challenge and kill the legendary former Shadow of Iga for his betrayal of their clan. After the two young ninjas fought, Hayabusa would lie on the ground, staring up at the full moon in the sky, the reflection of the moonlight in his eyes quietly burning into Hanabi's heart. Having never felt this kind of feeling before, Hanabi became very distressed. Whenever she saw Hayabusa and the young spiritualist girl known as Kagura smiling and laughing as they greeted each other, her heart would fill with inexplicable rage and vexation. When she heard that Hayabusa would become the clan's next Shadow, she decided to take on the name Scarlet, and from the secret vault of the Supreme Grandmaster, she stole her sect's forbidden weapon - the Higanbana. Hanabi decided that she would challenge her age-old rival to one final competition, and now her one aim in life is to find and kill the disgraced former Shadow before Hayabusa does.",

It is also said that this mysterious place holds the key to ruling the world. Eons ago, the ruler of the Celestial Palace used the technological secrets of the ancients to create Uranus, and commanded his creation to guard the city and wait for the emergence of a new ruler. \n\nWhen scholars from the Land of Dawn found and opened the gates to the Celestial Palace, the battle between the Dawn Zenith and the Dark Abyss quickly spread throughout the realm, disrupting the quietude of this ancient city. The two camps sought to occupy the Celestial Palace as a symbol of victory, their heroes unleashing the full extent of their power before finally reaching an impasse. The massive energy released throughout their incessant battles eventually awakened the ancient city's defense system, and was converted directly into lighting power which fed and reawakened Uranus, who lay dormant in depths of the Celestial Palace. \"Leave now, intruders!\" he roared upon awakening, and then charged to the battlefield, fueled by lightning, aether, and boundless rage. The guardian has returned, and is now ready to fulfill his destiny. His goal -- to expel these savage intruders disturbing the tranquility of the Celestial Palace.",

At the heart of the Shura clan's beliefs lies the legend of the Three Thousand Worlds. The legend speaks of three thousand secret worlds, which upon entering, one must face various levels of psychic trials and advance to world after world upon victory. The people of the Shura clan have discovered a way to enter these worlds, and only those who have conquered over three hundred worlds are granted the title of \"Ashura\", raising them to the level of a demigod in the eyes of their people. However, in the innumerable eons of Shura history, none managed to conquer the fabled three thousand worlds, until Martis appeared. \n\nWith ambition and determination capable of shaking the very heavens, Martis trained every day of his life to become stronger, tirelessly advancing through the secret worlds, with each personal breakthrough against the legions of demons granting him a sense of unique personal satisfaction. No one knows how many years passed before Martis reached the final secret world, but his desire for glory drove him onwards. After numerous defeats, he fell into despair, but even then, he refused to give up. He transformed his sheer thirst for victory into twin blades of righteous fury, now known as the Ashura's Teeth, and for countless days and nights, battled against the demons of the final world with strength and determination never seen before on the mortal plane. He finally became the first Ashura to defeat the three thousand secret worlds and has since been regarded as 'King Ashura', ruling tens of millions of aspiring Ashura.",

It was also known as the place of trial for Mages eager to master flame spells. After leaving the magic academy, Valir dwelled himself there for five years while carrying a ten-year promise with Vale. He hoped that day would come more quickly, but at the same time, he also hoped that day would never come. One day, Valir cast his arcane flame magic towards the volcano but the result was not to his expectation\n\nIn the western desert, there was a man who was looking for Valir. The betrayal of years was something he could never forgive. With great anger and hate, and to maintain the reputation of the magic academy, he decided to track down the traitor. The moment he felt an unusual arcane power releasing from the volcano, he smiled.\n\nThe long-term inhabitance in this “Inferno of Fire” brought changes to Valir’s body. His skin was burned by the flames of the volcano, but in order to become the Son of Flames, he had to combine the power of his arcane flame magic with the volcano’s inferno fire. His body and his will must withstand the trials of these scalding lava. Suddenly, a strong wind blew, bringing a familiar sense to Valir. Vale had come! They had never met each other since childhood. This encounter led to the first fight between them, between fire and wind. The Windtalker and the Son of Flames cast their all magic to attack each other. No words were exchanged, but they shared a common thought – they didn’t want to kill each other. However, their fight generated great power, which was aggravated the volcano. If the volcano burst, they would surely die in an inferno.\n\nFive years left - can’t you wait Vale!? \n\nBefore Vale said anything, Valir heard another familiar voice, it was Gord. Gord’s presence interrupted this fight between these brothers. He wanted to abolish the arcane magic of Valir, because in his mind, his pure arcane wisdom should never be tarnished. However, the arcane spell he cast to Valir was stopped by Vale. Vale turned to sympathy upon looking at Valir’s tortured body. He didn’t want anyone to hurt his brother. However, Valir didn’t need such sympathy. \n\nOne of them was his master who wanted to destroy his apprentice for his apparent betrayal. \n\n Another one of them had been his closest brother. However, he was also the son of the one who killed Valir’s father.\n\nThe sacred flame would never be quenched. Valir successfully combined the power of his arcane flame magic with the inferno fire and burst out a powerful energy. With this power, the lava became unstable. Meanwhile, Valir gained a mighty body while his eyes became scarlet flames. At that time, Vale could understand his father’s worries. This kind of power astonished Gord, and as his teacher, he would rather kill his student than to let him be possessed by this crazy power. \n\nValir’s flame, Vale’s wind, and Gord’s arcane power aggravated the volcano, which led to a great collapse. After that, Vale and Gord tried to find Valir, but they couldn’t find him. Vale knew that in his heart Valir was still alive,and that their ten-year promise was not yet broken. The five-years made Valir formidable, what was to happen after another five years? Vale knew the next time they encountered each other, it would no longer be as friends and brothers. Rather, it would be about the greatest fight for their lives.",

In their eyes, the path of the magician is the most sacred and noble vocation there is, and all those who brandish a sword in battle are merely weak, dim-witted fools. Gusion, however, is determined to break the mold. The patriarch's fourth son, Gusion, exhibited a high affinity towards light elements at a very early age, but rather than spend his days with his nose buried in a book, Gusion would use his control over light to imbue himself with the speed to run laps of the family estate in mere minutes, and to enchant old ceremonial swords with powerful light energy. He always believed that the family elders were incurably stubborn and rebelled against their wishes at every opportunity. \n\nFinally, Gusion was given the chance to prove himself, when the time came for him to take the Paxley family's most important test -- a rite of passage into adulthood. With Gusion's blistering speed in battle, his opponent was unable to lock onto his position, and with his light-charged blade, he claimed victory before his opponent even had a chance to launch a single spell. The elders were in awe of his incredible form and fighting technique, but with their deep-rooted prejudice against physical combat and their strict adherence to tradition, they gave Gusion two choices: to either abandon his fighting style or be banished from the family. Facing such adversity and unable to control his rebelliously independent nature, Gusion chose to leave the family, convinced that soon the entire Land of Dawn would know his name and understand the true extent of his power.",

But as his co-founders fell deeper and deeper into their depraved human weaponization experiments, Dr. Baker felt he had no choice but to leave and pursue a new project. Renouncing the questionable ethics of human experimentation, he endeavored to create a new kind of lifeform, solely from a mechanical skeleton, puppet strings, and synthetic skin, and finally, a new generation of artificial life was born. Dr. Baker firmly believed that love and hope were the greatest inventions of mankind, so he programmed the world's most moving stories into the heart of his new creation. \n\nOne bright morning, Peace Android Prototype 1 awakened from her bed, and Dr. Baker bestowed upon this adorable mechanical angel, the name Angela. Angela followed Dr. Baker's tutelage, studying hard to understand the world, and hoping to meet the doctor's high expectations. However, their peaceful life together was soon cut short. When the mad scientists of Lab 1718 heard rumors that Dr. Baker had created a living soul outside of a human body, they couldn't believe it. They convinced themselves that Baker had betrayed them, keeping this knowledge to himself before fleeing, and so they ordered Dr. Baker's past creations, Alpha and Beta, to hunt down Dr. Baker and Angela. As their pursuers were just about to close in on them, Dr. Baker placed Angela into a flight capsule, instructing her to seek out his good friend Dr. Rooney. \n\nHowever, the flight capsule was struck down in a terrible thunderstorm, and landed in a remote corner of the Land of Dawn. Emerging from the wreckage, Angela began her journey to find Dr. Rooney and save her father.",

No one knows the true purpose of these organizations, but one thing is for sure: whenever a crisis is at hand, mysterious figures emerge from the shadows to restore order to the world. \n\nProfessor Henry and his wife worked for the Dawn Council, known for its research in cutting-edge technology, providing an endless and varied stream of high-tech products to government agencies and mysterious, anonymous clients. But when they finally finished developing the \"SMART-01\", all this changed, as their new creation was more intelligent and powerful than any android the world had seen before. It was designed so that once a genetically matched host controlled him, he could act according to the controller's consciousness. The leaders of the Dawn Council saw the potential of this technology for warfare and ordered the Henrys to transfer the technology to selected government agencies for a mass production program. The Henrys refused. \n\nAfter ordering their Prototype One to destroy all of the experiment's data, the Henrys mysteriously disappeared. To this day, little Alice has no knowledge of these events. All she knows and cares about is that this special robot has always been there to protect and accompany her, and that he calls her \"Honey\" like her father once did, while she affectionately calls him \"Jawhead\" in return. The only clue left behind by her parents was a pocket watch she carries with her wherever she goes. Eventually, Alice decides to journey with her robot friend to track down her parents' whereabouts...",

As the assailants approached the Vance household, Lesley took up her father's black long rifle and fulfilled her late father's mission. Tears rolled down Lesley's cheeks as she fired shot after shot, each one taking down an assassin. The final tear came as the final shot took down the last of the rival family's men. \n\n Lesley was adopted by the Vance family, with the patriarch of the noble house even putting their sole heir, Harley, under her tutelage. Harley was a natural troublemaker who used his talents in magic to cause trouble for the Vance household. Only Lesley could keep Harley under control. Harley's troublemaker streak was the last part of warmth within Lesley's conscience. \n\nAfter hearing about how Harley had travelled to the dangerous Land of Dawn, Lesley followed along with her trusty heirloom rifle. After a long arduous journey, she found that Harley, the once immature young boy, had changed through the numerous life experiences he had endured. She decided it would be best to have her adopted little brother train here, while she silently protects him from the shadows. From that day on, all the monsters that were inflicted with Harley's magic would also be struck with a black bullet. Stories of the magical youngster that was followed by a mysterious black sniper soon spread.",

This race was united by the Crow King Osana, under whose venerable leadership they perfected the art of Sky Magic.This unique school of magic allows its wielder to soar across the skies, and grants the ability to strike from enormous distances, however, only those who have had their blood \"awakened\" can use it. \n\nThe noble Princess Pharsa was born with an unknown type of blood which was said to hold enormous potential if awakened, but as hard as they tried, the baffled people of her tribe failed to unleash its true power. Soon enough, Pharsa's special blood became a burden, as ill-intentioned opportunists from across the land sought to reap it for their own benefit. On the day of Pharsa's wedding, the tyrannical witch Alice invaded the Askati Forest, mercilessly slaying countless Crows and leaving a smoldering trail of ruin in her wake. Numbed to the core by the carnage surrounding her, Pharsa dropped Osana's ancient crown to the floor. Her appearance began to change, as unprecedented power coursed through her veins -- her blood had been awakened. Pharsa's eyes clouded over, as one side of her hair turned pure white, and she soared into the sky to unleash a torrential assault of horrifying magical power fierce enough to drive Alice away. \n\nVerri, the love of her life, couldn't bear to see his betrothed suffer a life of blindness alone, and chose to accompany Pharsa wherever she went, utilizing his own magic to become permanently linked to Pharsa, and allowing her to see through his eyes. Pharsa wishes her power had never been awakened, she wishes even more that her home had not been destroyed, but that witch took everything from her, and now it is time for revenge...",

Their bodies were transformed using dark magic, granting them the ability to swallow light and travel through space in the blink of an eye, allowing them to surprise their enemies with deadly sneak attacks. What was most terrifying about them, however, was the concoction of natural poisons emitted from their tails, for those unfortunate enough to come into contact with this poison would soon be saying their last words. \n\nHowever, this is what caused the ultimate demise of this race. In the annals, the specifics of how this race were wiped out are not made clear, but it is certain that this terrifying race definitely walked upon on the Land of Dawn. Since their extinction, humanity had progressed prosperously, however, the history books could not predict that one day these creatures would slowly creep out of the shadows once more...",

At a young age he showed exquisite talent in the art of fencing, garnering the praise of the masses to the extent where he eventually became lost in delusions of grandeur. \n\nWhen the magical tribes of the south attacked, Lancelot, who had just awoken from a drunken stupor, arrogantly attacked them alone. After winning a few battles, he dropped his guard and pursued the remaining forces, but soon the tribes regrouped and defeated him, sending him plummeting to the mountain depths. \n\nHe was found and nursed back to health by Princess Odette, and soon became enamored with her purity, understanding how wrong he was to be so arrogant and shallow in the past. While recovering at Swan Castle, Lancelot soon realized the magical potential of the Regina family, and was able to integrate it into his fencing, culminating in the shadow step maneuver. Now, he once again sets foot in the arena of battle to test his new skills.",

It is the Swan Lake, named after the beautiful yet authoritative Swan Castle that lies on the lake's shores. Many years ago the Regina family fled from the empire's capital to the lake in order to escape political conflicts and erected a Swan-like castle. \n\nAccording to legend, when Odette, the thirteenth generation scion was born, swans flocked to the castle to pay their respects. Princess Odette is said to have a contagious smile, leading people to say she is a goddess in human form. In order to match the praise that people have piled on her, Windor mastered the most difficult of noble magic. \n\nDespite being universally admired, Odette was lonely until chance brought her to Lancelot, whose wounds had led him to faint on the lakeshore. During Lancelot's recovery, the two soon developed a deep unconditional love.",

The Angel of Light, Rafaela, shone down on the people and healed all of their illnesses; the Angel of Dark, Argus, became the punisher of crime. Together they maintained peace and balance throughout the land.\n\nRafaela and Argus were originally angelic partners who operated with a tacit understanding. Though Argus was in charge of punishment and possessed an extreme personality, he still established the Temple of Light to show the people of the realm that there was more to the world than war and conflict; that kindness, comfort and encouragement should also fill their lives. As such, he did not always resort to punishment and death while managing the affairs of the empire. As time passed, those who Argus had to punish increased in both evilness and strength. In order to face these opponents, it was necessary for him to become increasingly stronger himself. But even Argus was late to realize that he had become addicted to the rush of defeating strong enemies in battle. He had once acted purely to punish those who sinned, but now sought only his own strength and glory. It was in this way that Argus fell from grace.\n\nArgus' situation had long been watched by the Lord of the Abyss, who intentionally caused crimes that pushed Argus further into his corruption. He promised Argus that using dark powers would increase his strength, and in order to win himself such a strong servant even baited Argus with knowledge of an ancient seal of power. Completely driven by his lust for power, Argus broke the ancient seal and released from within it the evil sword Demise. Argus fell completely under the Abyss Lord's control, acting as his most loyal servant.\n\nLegend states that the user of the sword Demise will be drained of all lifeforce until taken by death. Consumed by his desire for power, Argus sacrificed his life to the blade and coexists with it in dark equilibrium. He hungers for battle and chaos, thirsts for worthy opponents who can satisfy his taste for combat. He is an angel whose blade blackens souls.\n\nThe Angel of Light Rafaela has never stopped searching for him. She knows that the corruption of an angel is far worse than the corruption of any man. In each of her attempts to heal the corruption and desire in Argus' heart, she is inevitably attacked and chased away. Faced with the new Argus, a stranger to his former self, she cries tears of regret. Argus, however, holds nothing back in his attacks against Rafaela. The redemption of the Angels of Dark and Light will influence the fate of the realm.",

It said that this race is older than the earth itself, and having a special affinity for nature, they were able to build deep connections and relations with various beings of nature, especially the Stone Titans. \n\nThese amiable giants possess rocky skin that is almost impervious to all physical force, but due to their kind nature, they mainly use their physical prowess to sleep safely. These stony giants love sleeping so much that they will hibernate for up to half a year sometimes, however once they are awakened, it is hard for them fall asleep again. One day when Grock awoke again, he found himself to be alone with the guardians of the fortress long gone. He proceeded to saddle the fortress onto his back to find the owners, setting out all over the Land of Dawn to find any news of their whereabouts, so he may one day return their home to them.",

Being protected by the mother smilodon, the little smilodon Leo and Irithel learned to hunt, survive, and grew up like an animal. During a territory fight, the mother smilodon was badly injured. When Irithel and her \"brother\" Leo went to a town for help, they were captured as \"smilodon children\" by a slaveholder. When the cat elf mage - Nana - passed by and couldn't watch them get beaten to death, she suddenly had the super power inside her that allowed her to save these two poor children. With the help of Nana, Irithel was able to understand human languages and combat skills while Leo grew up to become a strong adult smilodon. But Irithel still hates humans and trusts her only friend - Leo.",

Since Karrie was a child, she was very talented and trained into an excellent and arrogant warrior leader. But at the same time, she lost her feelings and became a machine. During one battle, she was overconfident and got seriously injured. But a prophet from another race saved her and injected his consciousness into her brain. Since then there has been a voice in her head; the prophet told her that the ruin of her empire is about to come and there will be no Yasson anymore. After her escape from death, Karrie didn't believe the voice in her head. But she started to suspect it was right after returning to her empire. In order to save her empire, and for her own redemption, Karrie chose to believe and came to the Land of Dawn. What kind of destiny is waiting for her?",

He was once an upstanding soldier of the empire whose greatest strength and weakness was his stubbornness. After leaving the army he became an experienced hunter who earned a living with his trade. Many dangerous animals live in the Black Forest. The most terrifying of these are not the rare magical beings but the hundreds of wolves led by Pale Tusk, the new Wolf King. They use their skills in group tactics to attack in packs, and Pale Tusk himself has awakened magic abilities within him with the help of an ancient power. In order to satisfy their need for food, the wolves began to appear outside the borders of the Black Forest where they would attack travelers passing by.\n\nMotivated by his sense of justice, Roger decided to remove this threat to the common people. He followed Pale Tusk's tracks and discovered the wolves had surrounded a small village in preparation to attack. Suddenly a wolf's howl broke the silence, and the pack of wolves rushed in and attacked all the inhabitants of the village. Just as Pale Tusk was about to feast on an injured little girl, Roger used his hunting instincts to launch an attack and save the girl, whose name was Ruby. Roger succeeded in pushing back Pale Tusk and his wolves but was injured by the Wolf King in the battle. Roger mimicked the language of the wolves to warn Pale Tusk to leave the village. The retreating Pale Tusk looked back at the bloodied Roger, a look of enmity in his eyes. Unable to forget the fear that pierced his heart that day, Roger began to worry that Pale Tusk would come back for revenge. He began to train Ruby in how to fight wolves. During this training, his body began to change. He knew these changes were somehow related to Pale Tusk. For the safety of the others, Roger left the village in secret.\n\nWhen Roger returned to his home, he slowly realized that the ancient power Pale Tusk carried had begun to infect his own body. \"Even one of a pure heart, one who misses not once his nightly prayers, is helpless to resist the lupine transformation in the dark grass under a moonlit sky.\" On the night of a full moon, Roger was horrified to discover that the legend was true as he transformed into a werewolf. In order to avoid hurting others in his deranged transformed state, he had no choice but to leave his home.",

Under the protection of the King of Light, they lived a peaceful life. But deep underground, the Dark Lord of the Abyss was plotting to invade their land. The Dark Lord sent the enchanting vampire queen, Alice, to seduce the king. The king stopped attending court and no longer cared for his once beloved queen or kingdom. \n\nThe king's betrayal razed the queen's sanity in flames of jealousy, and in an attempt to win back her husband's heart, she made a deal with the Dark Lord to regain her youth and beauty. Every day in the kingdom, another young and beautiful maiden went missing, and a panic fell over the people. The country grew weaker with each passing day, and the sacrifices demanded by the queen's sorcery grew as well. Finally, the kingdom collapsed, with no more sacrifices to be found, and the devouring power of darkness suddenly caused the queen to become a wizened and frightening monstrosity. \n\nA thousand years have passed, and this unknown kingdom has since disappeared in the winding river of history, leaving only the legend of the demon queen. Very few today connect this tale with the great and terrible Necromancer Vexana in the Land of Dawn. After all, it happened so very long ago.",

Life thrives, and food is in abundance. People live lives of peace and happiness. But one day, a group of invaders came upon this peaceful land and disrupted the happy lives of the people. \n\nThe chief of Makadan Island, Lapu-Lapu, refused to become anyone's slave. \"The enemy has iron spears. We have brave hearts,\" he declared. Lapu-Lapu took up his twin blades and led his people into battle, slaying countless invaders. Under his leadership, they won victory and the respect of the enemy, free once again to live in peace. But this incident of \"outside invaders\" made our hero aware of the world beyond the island, and though beset by enemies, he packed his bags and began a journey to learn about this world.",

The land's infertile soil required everyone in the clan to become a good hunter in order to acquire precious meat. Born with great strength, Hilda soon became the leader of the hunting party and led her people to harvest great amounts of food. \n\nHowever, an unknown power in their territory drove wild animals into a frenzy and it became more and more difficult to hunt. Eventually, crazy beasts started to attack the clan. As the patriarch's premonition of a crisis started to become a reality, Hilda was forced to search for new habitats. With the hopes and dreams of the tribe on her back, she headed to the Land of Dawn. With her rich hunting experience, she became a mercenary of great reputation and expertise. Her only wish is to find a new home for her people and to fight for their future.",

Every elven king was born in the Tree of Life at the center of the Emerald Woodland. \n\nThe elven king of the current generation is the unique Estes, who was badly hurt during the second plain war and had to go into a deep sleep in the Emerald Woodland. Moon elves lost the guidance from their king ever since that day. When the flames of wars between humans and orcs burned on this peaceful woodland, the young Moonlight Archer, Miya, stood up and gathered the rest of the elves to protect their homeland. \n\nHowever, the dominator of dark abyss is thirsty for more believers and the dark force has been growing stronger in secret. Seduced by the Blood Queen, Alice, some young elves have fallen. The race of moon elves was once again at stake which outraged the great elven king! During a night of great thunder and lightning, Estes woke up. He's strict but benevolent,and empowered with the strength of the sacred moonlight to protect his people and to support his allies. With the Code of Moonlight in his hands, he swore to repel every enemy who dares to violate his homeland.",

He led his team to lift the champion's trophy and achieved the highpoint of his life as a superstar quarterback with millions of fans. However, fortune is always fickle. A little girl suddenly rushed into the road while Johnson was driving his sports car. To avoid hitting the little girl he swerved and severely crashed his car. A massive hemorrhage was going to take his life quickly. \n\nAt that moment, a miracle occurred. The wreckage of the sports car started to combine with Johnson's body by a mysterious force. Because of this, he not only survived the crash but also became a magical new human who could transform into a sports car.",

He inherited the family's occult spear fighting skills and, as the next leader of the clan Wildsand, he was loved and respected by many. Watching the Wildsand clan growing stronger day by day, the khan of Thornwolf, who is the leader of the Hietala Grassland, couldn't sit back any longer. One day when the youngsters of Wildsand went out hunting, the Khan slaughtered the entire Wildsand clan. The whole land was scorched by blazing flames of war. Blood flowed like water, yet a slight warmth remained on the bodies of dead families and friends. Faced with this cruel vision, Moskov could not persuade himself to accept it. But even worse, the khan dispatched a formidable cavalry trying to hunt down Moskov's hunting party which were the only survivors from the massacre. In a panic, some fled while others wanted to surrender. Moskov, for the very first time, lifted his spear and aimed it at his own people. \n\nSuffering from this painful experience, Moskov became ruthless with the thought of revenge haunting him constantly. However, the khan was too strong to defeat. In order to obtain more power, Moskov chose to fall into the Abyss of Shadow and serve the Queen of Doom, becoming notorious as 'the Spear of Quiescence' ever since.",

At a time when the nation was in danger, Yi Sun-shin built a powerful navy and created the iron armored 'turtle ship'. This made an indelible contribution to the Korean Kingdom which became known for dominating the sea areas. 'Wherever iron turtle ship sails, the sea areas belong to me.' said Yi. \n\nYi was excellent at the strategy of 'overtaking the majority with the minority'. Under his leadership, the Korean navy defeated over 330 enemy warships with only 12 ships, gaining a great triumph at the Battle of Myeongnyang. To this day, the legend of this Asian general still lives on in the hearts of people.",

In a small cabin, a little girl was kneeling on her bed, praying. Next to her stood disproportionately giant scythes. She was praying for the return of the legendary hunter - Roger. Only he could save the village from being vandalized by the wolves. \n\nYears earlier, Roger saved her family by accident when he was wandering in the Land of Dawn. His bravery took a huge toll on the wolves. At the request from the elderly in the village, Roger finally stayed to train the villagers. One day, he left the village without any notice and no trace to be found. \n\nWhat happens in the fairy tales can seldom be the same in reality. On a silent, moonless night, Pale Tusk, the wolf king, caught the village off guard and sneaked in with his pack. In the end, her grandfather and grandmother died trying to protect Ruby, who in turn made a narrow escape by hiding under the corpses of her grandparents. No one could imagine that from the moment she witnessed her grandparents' death, her character would completely change. Outraged, she got back on her feet, picked up the scythes, rushed into the wolves, and slaughtered almost all of them. Under her seemingly weak appearance now lies an unsettling, irritable soul. Pale Tusk was the only survivor among the wolves. Staring at the skyline, Ruby decided to make a happy ending for all the good people in every story. Pale Tusk was never defeated before but this time it came in the severest way. Ruby gradually regained consciousness after Pale Tusk left. Now, whenever the wolves howl, her eyes become once more filled with rage.",

Using human bodies as biological material and space meteorites as metal skeletons, they created powerful twins. Alpha and Beta, also known as 'Flesh Weapon', can utilize a supernatural power that's ubiquitous but very mystery. However, the twins had always had a strong conscience and refused to become killing machines. Getting help from Saber, they escaped from the alt-world. However, on their way to escape, Beta's core was destroyed. All that Alpha could retrieve was Beta's half metallic arm. After coming to the Land of Dawn, with the help of master machinist Rooney, Beta now keeps Alpha company in the form of an aircraft.",

Despite the dreadful conditions, Chou kept his heart of kindness, as day in and day out he continued to look after the old and the young there with passion. During this time, there was great turmoil and unrest in the Land of the Dawn; mayhem spread throughout the land and eventually started to affect this small remote area. \n\nOne day, Chou rescued a mystic monk under pursuit by his captors and took him back to his slum to care for him. In return, the monk imparted the ancient Asian Kung-Fu skill to Chou and told him that the world needed a real hero to stand up and end the chaos. Chou made a vow right then and there that he would start on his journey in the Land of Dawn to become a true hero without looking back. As Chou was leaving, the monk nodded and disappeared into the shadows.",

After learning that her childhood playmate Hayabusa had departed for the Land of Dawn to undertake a dangerous mission, Kagura secretly took the Seimei umbrella and followed in Hayabusa's step, hoping to help him in battle.",

Although she was able to escape danger with Tigreal's help, this was undoubtedly a severe blow to Natalia's pride. \n\nTo prove herself again, she exiled herself to the outskirts of the land, far from the Empire and the Church, to carry out more dangerous missions.

He was born with the gift to manipulate the mystic powers which allowed him to master several sophisticated spells at an early age. But this is clearly a double-edged sword as Gord became increasingly arrogant over time. Once he stumbled across a forbidden book in the academy which recorded the method to forge the pure mystic existence out of human body using mystic powers.\n\nThe young wizard buried himself in the book and launched his study without respecting the opinions from the outside. It worked out successfully in the beginning, the pure mystic energy started to flow in Gord's veins, thus he was able to cast even more powerful spells. Unfortunately, Gord was not able to control this power and he became overwhelmed with mystic energy. Gord then tried to seek a solution from ancient magic sources. With the combination of the two different energies, Gord's body was almost devastated. Thanks to the help from Elward, the chief wizard, the turbulence in his body was finally able to be controlled. The incident took a huge toll on Gord, leaving his body half red and half blue. While he was saved, Gord can never again control the magic contained in pure mystic energy.\n\nElward encouraged Gord until he finally got back on his feet. Elward then invited Gord to continue his career as a wizard and invited him to teach at the academy. After careful consideration, Gord accepted the offer. He wished to find a student who will carry on his studies without making the same mistakes. From that day, Gord started a new life as the strictest professor in the magic academy.",

                        "tale": "Valkyries were distinguished and revered fighters among the warlike Northern Vale folks. The bravest and strongest female warriors in each tribe would be chosen to join their rank and take up the responsibility of guiding the spirits of fallen heroes into Valhalla and keeping the peace in Northern Vale. Becoming a Valkyrie would bring glory to everyone in the tribe, it was the greatest achievement one could ever dream for. But such a glory came with a price, and Valkyries had to make huge sacrifices for their privilege. “They shall never marry or bear children, they shall dedicate their entire live to the Northern Vale.”\n\nAt first, such glory and burden did not belong to Freya. As far as Freya could remember, her elder sister Skuld was their tribe’s best hope. She was clever, decisive, brave and resilient. She could already defeat all the other warriors in their tribe when she was only sixteen years old. The high priest of the Martyr Shrine foresaw the future in a prophecy. “A female warrior, daughter of the Northern Vale, will one day lead this land to a new path.” Everyone believed that the kid in the prophecy was Skuld, so she kept training day and night, hoping that one day she could take up the mantle and bring a glorious future to her tribe and the Northern Vale.\n\nUnlike her sister Skuld, young Freya lived a carefree life. She was naughty, vigorous and curious. She admired her sister Skuld, believing that she could live happily ever after so long as her brilliant and lovingly sweet sister was with her. But her sister Skuld disagreed. She would always encourage Freya, saying that Freya would one day become the person who could lead their tribe and even all the Northern Vale folks.\n\nWhen Freya was twelve, Skuld passed the high priest’s trial, became an exalted Valkyrie of the Martyr Shrine, and left her homeland. Two years later, Freya sneaked out of the tribe by herself and headed to Martyr Shrine, the place where all Northern Vale folks were forbidden to visit. She missed her sister so much that she was dying to see Skuld.\n\nHer destiny was changed entirely that day. Outside of the Martyr Shrine, Freya was peeking at the Valkyries who were holding a transcendence ritual for the spirits of the dead. But inside this empty hall, a strange light caught Freya’s attention. Freya approached, and realized that it was a strange object floating above the altar. Its radiance encircled itself, like a giant light orb. It felt like there was a wonderful dreamland hidden in its light, calling Freya to come. Propelled by this mysterious force, Freya was unknowingly drawn to it, and reached out to touch the light orb floating above the altar.\n\nSuddenly, an immense amount of energy raged inside the orb, then broke free from the seal of the altar, rising straight toward the sky. What Freya didn’t know was that this orb, Heart of Aurora, was actually an ancient relic kept and worshiped by the Northern Vale for the past hundreds of years. But it also had another secret identity: it was the legendary Apocalypse Shard.\n\nAfter Freya accidentally touched it, the immense energy once contained within the Heart of Aurora got out of control and started to grow ever stronger. Should it exploded and spread, the entire Northern Vale would be swept away. This anomaly startled the priests and Valkyries outside. Facing this dire situation, the high priest told everyone that they had to jump into the energy field to be able to stop the energy from growing. Just as Freya was shocked and frozen by this terrible scene, a familiar and gentle figure appeared and hugged her from behind. Skuld emerged from the Valkyries, and gave her own sword and shield to Freya. Skuld smiled to her, then dived into the energy field.\n\nThe lights became blinding, then everything stopped, and peace was restored in the hall of Valhalla. But after this accident, Skuld and the Heart of Aurora gone rogue both went missing, never to be found again. Freya was in deep sorrow, she blamed herself for this tragedy. The old high priest approached and caressed her forehead. He told Freya that Skuld had always had high hopes for her sister, she believed that Freya was the chosen one, she believed that Freya could lead Northern Vale to a different path.\n\nDevastated by the sense of guilt, Freya took up her sister's sword and shield along with her faith on her, and walked into the endless dark night. After years of training and extraordinary efforts, Freya finally became a Valkyrie at the age of twenty. She returned to the Martyr Shrine, took up her sister’s mantle, and kept watch for Northern Vale.\n\nTimes flew by as Freya stood guard in coldness and snow as a Valkyrie. She had been to everywhere in Northern Vale over the years, reconciling conflicts and resolving difficulties for people. She gave everything she had to Northern Vale, like a caring elder sister. \n\nAs Captain Bane and his Black Shark Pirates rose, the world of Northern Vale shifted. The merciless Captain Bane and his mortal enemy Franco fought each other fiercely along the coast shore, and the newfound traces of the “Heart of Aurora” drew lots of attentions. The news came: the endless conflict between Bane and Franco, the “Heart of Aurora” that sank into the bottom of ocean, the lurking darkness. She remembered the tragedy that happened years ago and deeply missed her sister. Everything was calling Freya, leading her toward the coast shore.\n\nThere, she would find all the answers she sought, and she would protect her homeland at all cost as a Valkyrie of Northern Vale.",

Over time, beliefs within the order diverged, and the Scarlet Shadow split into two factions -- the Scarlet Sect and the Shadow Sect. Conflict between the two sects gradually intensified, even to the point of drawing swords on one another. In order to avoid bloodshed, the two sects decided that every ten tears they would select the best Scarlet ninja and the best Shadow ninja to duel. The winner would inherit the title \"Scarlet Shadow Grandmaster\", under whom the two sects would study according to the ninja code left behind by their god. Ten years ago, a Shadow emerged possessing the kind of exceptional ability one sees only once in a hundred years. Even the Scarlet sect recognized his talent, but as they anticipated the day this Shadow would inherit the Scarlet Shadow title to unite the two sects and resurrect the glory of the Order of the Scarlet Shadow, heinous events transpired that would change the ninja world forever. While undertaking a mission, the Shadow brutally killed the Scarlet Sect's leader and returned to assert his supreme dominance over the two sects. Betraying one's companions is the most unforgivable sin among ninjas, and the infuriated ninjas of the two sects decided to take action. They sent the foremost elite ninjas from the two sects to encircle the Shadow. The ensuing battle was the most chaotic in the Scarlet Shadow's history. The two groups of elite ninjas were all slain, and the injured Shadow fled the Scarlet Shadow with his life. This battle greatly weakened the sects, bringing shame to them both, and cracks between the factions emerged once again. In the end, the two sects agreed that whoever found and killed the disgraced Shadow would become the Scarlet Shadow Grandmaster. The patriarch of the Shadow Sect selected the young Hayabusa to undergo training to this end, teaching him the secret methods of shadow manipulation without reservation, and as fate predicted, ten years later he became the strongest ninja the Shadow Sect had ever seen, and their new rightful Shadow. However, Hayabusa knew in his heart that his only purpose was to kill the former Shadow. When the former shadow re-emerged in the Land of Dawn, Hayabusa knew that the day of reckoning was not far off...",

Her whole village was destroyed in the war and her family torn apart. Just as her own life was in grave peril, Dr. Rooney, the master machinist of the City of Scholars, found her when he was passing through and took her back to Eruditio. \n\nTo show her gratitude to the city, Lolita joined the City Guard and swore an oath to the death to defend its honor. Bruno very much admired and understood this young elf maiden's spirit, and so he put in a request with the city scholars for their most advanced tech crystal-- the Noumenon Energy Core-- and bestowed it to Lolita. \n\nThis powerful energy core endows Lolita's tiny frame with the ability to discharge massive Bursts of force, even allowing her to control a giant mechanical hammer with ease.",

She dreamed of becoming an emissary of the Land of Dawn who would fight to protect its peace. Her father was the most famous firearms master in the Land of Dawn's City of Scholars, but as a child Layla wasn't interested in the inventions of her family. As she grew up, she desired to become a famous mage and study at the Magic Academy, where she could study the magic of her dreams. But alas, reality was cruel. Her dreams were heartlessly rejected by her father, who himself dreamed of a day when the City of Scholars would surpass the Magic Academy in fame and power. He spent his time researching the ultimate firearm technology that would be more powerful than anything possessed by the Magic Academy. In his research he consulted many ancient records before discovering that deep within the Southern Abyss lied a magic stone that, if harnessed, could be used to produce firearms of incredible power. His goal of surpassing the Magic Academy was now within reach.\n\nPaying no mind to the concerns of his daughter and wife, he embarked on a dangerous expedition into the abyss. The road was far, but her father finally found the magic stone he was looking for on the edge of the abyss. Seeing that he would soon succeed in creating his ultimate weapon, Layla's father brimmed with excitement. After returning home he worked dawn to dusk on his final creation, not stopping even to eat or drink. But his joy did not last long. Excessive contact with the magic stone caused him to lose his mind, and his temper worsened as his actions became strange and erratic.\n\nStrange creatures silently entered the City of Scholars in search of their lost magic stone. These stones belonged to the Lord of the Abyss, who did not allow anything to be taken from his realm. The creatures could sense the stone's location, and they ambushed Layla's house within the City of Scholars. Her mother was killed, and her father completely lost all reason. The young Layla was terrified as it seemed that she, too, would fall victim to the claws of these strange beings. At the last second her father appeared and drew off the attackers, leaving Layla with no hope except for her father's newly-created Malefic Cannon. Layla pulled hard on the trigger, and the gun sprung to action just as the monsters leapt to attack her. The energies from the gun were so strong that their blast waves hit her father too. No longer of a reasoning mind, he looked silently at Layla before holding onto his injured arm and jumping out of the window. It was then that Layla's father left the City of Scholars. Layla decided she would learn the technology behind the Malefic Cannon and represent the City of Scholars throughout the land as she searched for her father. She trained constantly, and at the age of 16 embarked on her path to become a hero.",

Seldom did the Great Dragon gather with his sons, however, as the adopted son, Zilong assisted the Great Dragon instead of the royal sons. In the eyes of the Great Dragon, Zilong was way better in his personalities and abilities, which made Zilong deeply trusted by him. Long ago, Zilong swore an oath to roam from world to world, assisting wise rulers by the Great Dragon's decree. Whenever a new king was in need of his strength, Zilong traverses space and time to remove all obstacles and enemies before the king, using spear fighting techniques endowed upon him by the Great Dragon. Now the Land of Dawn is in great danger and Zilong has come to its aid. With his sense of justice and bravery, Zilong defeated many enemies and his name spread among the land. Regardless of how strong the enemy was, Zilong's spear would not forgive any evil who tried to destroy this continent.",

However, during a tragic accident, Bruno lost his two legs while saving the life of his partner. Sadly, this event caused Bruno to lose all hope in life. \n\nThe scholars of Antoinerei heard of Bruno's inspiring story and commended him for his bravery. Empathized with his tragedy and out of strong compassion, the scholars used the City's latest technology to create synthetic legs for Bruno. When Bruno took his first step he was shocked by the strange feeling of his synthetic legs but was amazed by how running felt like flying.\n\nTo express his gratitude, Bruno vowed to protect Antoinerei till the day he dies. The elated City's scholars quickly developed an energy ball as Bruno's main weapon, specifically to be used with his synthetic legs. From that day forward, any invader who set foot in Antoinerei was met by Bruno's relentless attack. The city people came to call him, \"The Protector of Antoinerei\".",

The Moon Elves who turned their backs on the light lost the blessing of the Moon God, and were gradually eroded from within by dark energy, with their skin becoming ashen and devoid of light. The Dark Elves, who make a living by providing assassination services for other races, are born assassins able to use dark energy with ease. \n\nKarina is one of the best among them, and her assassination tasks were always carried out to perfection. But as the Dark Elves sank deeper into the clutches of darkness, the most fanatical of them even sacrificed their own people to the demons of the Shadow Abyss in exchange for dark energy. As Karina watched these events transpire, she became filled with anxiety and confusion, and when her beloved sister, Selena, was chosen as the next sacrifice, Karina decided she could no longer stand idly by. She would never allow the demons to hurt her sister. \n\nShe fought off her own people with her twin shadow blades, but even Karina could not resist the siege of the Dark Elves. Beaten to the brink of death, Karina watched as her sister was taken away by the envoys of the Shadow Abyss. Powerless, she felt her vision gradually blurring as her younger sister's cries became more and more distant. Sorrow and despair filled Karina's heart. She prayed to all the gods she knew of, but to no avail. The Dark Elves raised their swords to end Karina's life, but were shocked to discover a dim blue glow radiating from the twin shadow blades in her hands. \n\nAlthough they had abandoned him for thousands of years, the Mood God still watched over the Elves, and granted Karina his blessing in her time of need. The Dark Elves could not believe what was happening before their eyes, and they chose to flee. A soft and gentle power trickled down from Karina's twin blades and into her body, dissipating the dark energy within her and healing her wounds. Karina stood up and vowed to turn from her dark past. From that day on, and enraged by the pain of losing her sister, no demon would escape the retribution of her moonshadow blades.",

In one of his trials, Tigreal's overconfidence led to Alucard's parents sacrificing their lives in order to save him from demons. Unable to accept this harsh reality, Alucard went into the territory of the demons in order to search for his parents. All he found on the battlefield, however, was the family crest worn on his parents' chest. He was then suddenly ambushed by the demons, who captured and tortured him for months. He was eventually freed by a demon hunter, after which he took up refuge as a resident of the Temple of Light.\n\nAlucard's youth was full of tragedy. During his captivity his mind was consumed with surviving moment to moment, and the rage within his heart was buried. Though he was humiliated countless times by his demon captors, he never gave up his desire for revenge. It was this desire that gave him strength to survive the months of imprisonment. Alucard became drawn to the abilities of the demon hunter who rescued him. Unwilling to return to the Order of Imperial Knights that him feel nothing but sadness, he went with the demon hunter to the Temple of Light. He trained there for many years, becoming an exceptional demon hunter himself. He spent his days researching how to better hunt and kill demons. Holding nothing but hate for demons in his heart, he follows the three principles of the demon hunters: independence from all organizations and territories; no mercy for even a single demon; and no \"last\" missions. The most mysterious things about him are the demonic claws on his right hand as nobody knows what they are or how they got there",

Since his youth, Tigreal was a loyal believer in the Lord of Light. He swore to become a member of the Knight's Order to defend the status and symbol of the Moniyan Empire throughout the Land of Dawn. He dedicated all his time to training. In each of their training simulations and tests Tigreal's performance became the benchmark that no other knight's could surpass. His mentors were the most revered of all the Imperial Knights. In order to prove himself and surpass them, he dedicated more time and energy than others to his betterment; even the smallest mistakes in his training would be corrected and practiced repeatedly in his free time. Eventually, his mentors declared him the Captain with the highest potential in all of the Knight's Order.\n\nHis mentors' comments gave Tigreal complete confidence in his abilities. Even the strongest of heroes, however, is not without weakness. While hunting demons during one of their trial missions Tigreal showed the slightest amount of compassion, hesitating to make a kill. In that moment of hesitation, he was ambushed by the demons and was gravely injured. He watched helplessly as his mentors sacrificed themselves to save him. It was this mission that made Tigreal understand that he still had a long path ahead of him if he wanted his name to be recorded in the history of the land, . After the returning to the empire, Tigreal became even more strict with himself. He required each of his men to come back from every mission without a single loss, and wouldn't tolerate a single mistake from any of his subordinates.\n\nEver since then the Paladin Tigreal can be seen at the frontlines of the battle, where he has never been defeated. Even the most evil of enemies didn’t dare to provoke Tigreal in battle, because they knew to do so would be to suffer his merciless assault. A staunch believer in the Lord of Light, he became a pillar of the Knights’ Order, and his name synonymous with bravery and fearlessness. In order to recognize his courage, the empire bestowed upon him the title of Warrior of Dawn.\n\nTigreal constantly sought out the bravest warriors of the land, and in his mind there was none better than Alucard. For a long time, however, he has been unable to convince Alucard to leave the Temple of Light and join him. He knows that Alucard was unable to move on from the death of his parents. Each time he walked up the steps to the Temple of Light, he did so with a heart full of regret.",

Cute, friendly and uninvolved in the conflicts of the world, they are the loyal preservers of the Enchanted Forest who make the area the fairyland paradise that it is. As the most ancient race of the Enchanted Forest, they possess a strong natural talent for all things magical.\n\nNana is special among the Leonins. With a bright personality and love of adventure, she is full of curiosity for all things new and hopes to one day leave her home and see the world.\n\nBut Nana also has a mischievous side that often causes trouble for those around her. She is naturally gifted with strong magical abilities, but doesn't know how to control them. The most serious time she lost control of her impressive abilities resulted in the destruction of almost half the forest. In order to protect the Leonins from her uncontrollable magic abilities, Nana decided to leave her home. In her travels she met a Moon Elf named Miya who suppressed Nana's magic abilities and then taught her the Moon Elves’ secret to control magical energies. The intelligent Nana quickly mastered the technique and became a powerful witch of the Leonin clan. She chose to follow Miya to the Land of Dawn in search for the new King.",

Underneath the surface of beauty and magic, there lay hidden great danger. Strange black shadows appeared near the forest that the Moon Elves’ home, and with their haunting presence the Moon Elves’ numbers began to shrink.\n\nThe Blood Demons are a race that drains the life force of others in order to maintain their own bodies, and the peace-loving Moon Elves had become their favorite prey. Estes, the Moon Elf King, battled against the Blood Demons in order to protect his people. But after Alice, the Blood Demon Queen, conquered the Orcs, her demonic reach extended even further into the Enchanted Forest. She hoped to acquire the power of the Moon Elves and Estes for herself, just as she did with the Orcs. Her strong ambition led her to repeatedly invade the Lake of the Moon God. Every time, she was beaten back by the formidable will of King Estes. Not willing to resign to defeat, Alice decided to lead her mutant Orcs in another attack against the Moon Elves. Near the end of the battle, King Estes gathered his full might and landed a heavy blow against Alice, greatly wounding the Blood Demon Queen. Though the battle had ended, the heavily injured Moon Elf King entered into a great sleep in the deep of the Enchanted Forest.\n\nToday, the appearance of the Twilight Orb has plunged the Land of Dawn into chaos once more. In the cracks of the abyss deep within the earth, the Abyssal Ruler thirsts for more followers to believe in him. His dark shadow has silently spread over the mountains of the South, and Alice has found strength in pledging herself to this power. Though she has not fully recovered her former strength, gaining the trust of the Abyssal Ruler has caused her former ambitions to rekindle. In order to more quickly to become whole again, she continues to drain the life force of all beings she meets; with the naive, newborn Moon Elves being her favorite prey. After achieving this temporary satisfaction, Alice has turned her eye towards a larger prey: the heroes from the Alt-World. \"Watch your back.\"",

Dr. Rooney hoped that this team would be able to unlock the ultimate potential of mechanical invention and lead the world into a glorious age of technology. But the radically intellectual scientists became more and more obsessed with modifications to the human body. They engaged in insane experiments that ignored the limits of the human body. They were willing to try anything, use any combination of technology and power, so long as it enhanced human abilities that had not yet been unlocked by nature. Because of this, Dr. Rooney was forced to disband this team and banished the scientists.\n\nThough they had lost Dr. Rooney's favor, the scientists did not abandon their dreams. They established a laboratory of their own, a symbol of the reverence they held for their inventions. Laboratory 1718 was thus born, and it gathered radical scientists from all parts of the world to conduct strict and rigorous experiments on its subjects with the goal of creating stronger, and ever more advanced human weapons. The scientists gathered the genes of hundreds of sword masters of all different races, combining them with cutting-edge technology to create the first artificial man. As Laboratory 1718's first creation, they named him Saber.\n\nSaber's personality was proud and aloof, the sword he wielded was capable of cutting space-time itself. With his sword he traveled between the dimensions, his skill unmatched by any enemy he encountered. And because of this, Saber was extremely lonely. When he returned back to Laboratory 1718 to repair himself after each battle, he was no longer able to remember who his opponent was. This realization caused him to become curious about the origins of his creation. He also began to wonder about his true identity; another question he was unable to answer at Laboratory 1718, where all he did was submit to his battle instincts as he completed missions. Gradually, he grew tired of such an existence and decided to break free from Laboratory 1718's control to travel to the Land of Dawn, where he hoped to find answers through endless battles.",

The Orcs were in servitude to the Blood Demons and in addition to searching for their own food, the enslaved Orcs were also tasked with hunting for a very special food for their masters: Moon Elves.\n\nThe Orcs suffered greatly during their 30 years of enslavement, and their great ancestor, the Crazed Savage, hoped for an early end to their slavery. The Orcs had organized rebellions against the Blood Demon rule in the past, but each time they were unsuccessful and were met with death and destruction. It was during one of the larger of these rebellions that the rebel leader's wife lost her life giving birth to Balmond. Balmond was raised by his father and their Orc clan. The unusual circumstances of his childhood led him to grow up with a violent temper and a love of battle. He achieved victories in all of his battles against the Moon Elves and Humans, and many became hopeful that he would continue in his father's legacy and eventually command the Orc army.\n\nGrowing fiercer with each battle, Balmond became the strongest warrior in the Orc tribe. Years later, after his father had grown old and was near death, he told Balmond of his mother's tragic death. This caused Balmond to be even more determined to free his people from enslavement at the hands of the Blood Demons. Balmond led his Orc tribe in a night assault against the Blood Demon's main camp. He hoped to defeat the Blood Demon leader, Alice, and thereby break the contract of enslavement between them. The Blood Demons, however, proved to be too strong for Balmond. In a moment of desperation, Balmond decided to bite one of the Blood Demons to suck their blood to acquire their special strength. The few Orcs remaining followed Balmond and grew stronger as the strength of the Blood Demons fused with their own. With his new power, Balmond swung his bloody axe and slaughtered all the Blood Demons before him. Alice knew that he was no longer an ordinary Orc, but a hybrid creature that would come to be known as the Bloodaxe Orc. Alice smirked as Balmond approached with his axe raised in preparation of her slaughter. Alice showed no fear even as it swung down, preparing to sever her head from her body. The axe was stopped by a mysterious power just as it was about to meet Alice's skull. It was then that Balmond realized that by acquiring the power of the Blood Demons he had become subjected to Alice's control - denying him and his people the freedom they longed for.\n\nEven today these events still weigh heavy on Balmond's heart. He never intended to become an orc hybrid, and now unable to escape Alice's control. The Blood Demons have become more powerful than ever with this new unholy blood alliance. Every time the Blood Demons summon Balmond, he would be forced to honor the contract. Unable to bend the will of his masters, Balmond suffers in solitude in his own prison until he is summoned by the Blood Demons where his Blood Axe reigns supreme.",

Despite their best efforts, Miya and her fellow elves were forced to make a last stand in the temple against the enemy. \n\nMiya knelt in the center of the temple to pray for one last time when all hope was lost.Then, a miracle occurred. The Moon God answered Miya's prayer and blessed her longbow with an ancient power. Miya grasped the newly endowed bow and fired an arrow, and with the power of the stars,turned into an eagle spirit and caused the enemy into chao. \n\nMiya led her people out of the temple, raining showers of star-wrought arrows upon the enemy with each pull of her bow. Meanwhile the magical eagle hovered over the enemy, singling them out and attacking them. Like a falling tide, the humans and orcs quickly started to retreat. Miya and her countrymen retook the shores of the Moon God, and the moon elves recognized Miya and her spirit eagle as the Moon God incarnated. \n\nThe young Miya knew in her heart that if this problem was not stopped at the root, the wars would never end. With the Moon God's blessing, she set out on a journey to the land of dawn, hoping to find a king who could bring peace and order back to this world.",
